Newly appointed as the teacher-in-charge for your school’s environmental programmes? Fret not, NEA is here to guide you and build your expertise in leading environmental outreach projects in your school.
Join NEA’s network of Environmental Education Advisors (EEAs)
NEA has built a network of Environmental Education Advisors (EEAs) as a robust network of teachers who plan, coordinate and implement environment programmes for their school students and staff as well as serve as the contact point between NEA and the schools.

EEAs serve as a bridge to educate the young on environmental messages and issues. EEAs are assisted in the development of environment programmes for their schools by student Environment Champions. EEAs also provide feedback to NEA on the programmes that NEA organises for schools and students.
