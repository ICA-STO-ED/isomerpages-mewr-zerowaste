### Programme for schools

NEA runs a series of programmes for students such as the Environment Challenge for Schools (ECS) where schools can partner with non-governmental organisations (NGOs), grassroots organisations (GROs) or businesses to come up with ideas to solve local environmental challenges. Your students can also be trained as Environment Champions to build their capabilities.
