Need some ideas on how minimise waste in your life? Here are some ideas to get you started! 


1. Swap out plastic bags for reusable bags
2. Don't leave the house without a full reusable water bottle.
3. Instead of ordering coffee to go, order coffee 'to stay'
4. Ask for drinks without a straw
5. Opt for paperless statements for your credit cards, mobile phone or utilities bills
6. Order only what you can finish when dining out
7. Store your food properly to make it last longer.
8. When placing orders for food online, choose the 'no cutlery' option
9. Repair old items or donate them instead of throwing them away
10. Avoid impulse buys
