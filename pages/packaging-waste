### Extended Producer Responsibility 


Singapore will introduce policies to encourage sustainable production and consumption. 

This includes Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR), starting with electronic-waste, which we will introduce by 2021. 

When producers are responsible for the ‘end-of-life’ of their products, they will be more incentivised to design products that are easily recycled, or come up with innovative circular business models to close their waste loop.
