### 1. Why are commingled recycling bins used in Singapore?

Our co-mingled recycling system makes it cost effective for recyclables to be collected and easy for residents to recycle. Residents do not need to segregate their recyclables nor set aside additional space to store the different types of recyclables (paper, plastic, metal and glass) separately in their homes. All the recyclables can be placed in a bag and deposited into the commingled recycling bin at any time. Commingled or single stream collection of recyclables is a cost-effective method of collection practised in several US cities as well as some parts of Europe and Australia.

### 2. Why don’t we need to sort our recyclables in Singapore?

Curabitur sed hendrerit sem, ut dignissim nisi. Aenean eleifend in ligula at posuere. Phasellus turpis justo, mollis eget sagittis vel, viverra quis enim. Praesent luctus, elit ac mattis cursus, dui lorem sollicitudin urna, ac molestie lacus elit eget eros. Sed aliquam purus vitae tellus consequat rutrum. Etiam tristique, mi ut dapibus tristique, elit urna rhoncus leo, ac luctus augue ante eget felis. Fusce nisl enim, tempus a faucibus aliquam, lobortis at est. Donec nec mollis nibh. Donec vitae ipsum risus. Pellentesque eu est sed diam pulvinar dictum in sit amet purus. Fusce convallis risus tortor.

### 3. Where can I find my nearest recycling bin?

A blue commingled recycling bin is provided to every HDB block and private landed property to make it more convenient for residents to recycle.

For HDB estate, commingled blue recycling bins are placed at open areas that are convenient and accessible to the residents. The bins are not placed at void decks for fire safety reasons.

For newer BTOs, there are dual chutes

For private landed estates, a commingled blue recycling bin, in addition to the refuse green bin, is provided to each house.


### 4. How often are recyclables collected?

The recyclables in the recycling bins in HDB estates are collected thrice a week, while the private landed properties are provided with weekly collection of recyclables and garden waste collection. Please refer to the table below for the collection frequencies of each PWC sector.

### 5. Who collects the recyclables in my estate?

It depends on where you stay. 
Under this programme launched in April 2001, the public waste collectors (PWCs) licensed by NEA are required to provide recycling bins and recycling collection services to all HDB estates, private landed properties and condominiums/private apartments opted into the public waste collection scheme.

### 6. What's the point of recycling? 

Recycling stops tonnes of rubbish being buried in landfill


### 7. Doesn't my recycling end up getting thrown away with the rubbish anyway?

This couldn’t be further from the truth! Your recycled material is a valuable resource. Once it has been collected (this includes recycling collected in the back of bin lorries) from your doorstep it's taken away to be sorted, bailed and then transported to reprocessors to be made into new products.
