### 1. Why are commingled recycling bins used in Singapore?

Our co-mingled recycling system makes it cost effective for recyclables to be collected and easy for residents to recycle. Residents do not need to segregate their recyclables nor set aside additional space to store the different types of recyclables (paper, plastic, metal and glass) separately in their homes. All the recyclables can be placed in a bag and deposited into the commingled recycling bin at any time. Commingled or single stream collection of recyclables is a cost-effective method of collection practised in several US cities as well as some parts of Europe and Australia.

### 2. Why don’t we need to sort our recyclables in Singapore?

We want to provide households with an accessible, reliable and convenient avenue to recycle so as to encourage more households to recycle. 

Items deposited in the blue bins will be collected and eventuallay sorted by workers at materials recovery facilities into different waste streams for recycling.


### 3. Where can I find my nearest recycling bin?

Blue recycling bins for comingled recyclables are placed at every block in public housing estates and are provided to every household living in landed homes. All condominiums will also have recycling bins within their estates. 

To make recycling even more convenient, new public housing developments launched since 2014 are fitted with dual chutes for refuse and recyclables. The measure will also apply to new non-landed private residential development applications submitted to URA from 1 April 2018. With these chutes in place, households will find it just as convenient to recycle as to dispose of their waste.


### 4. How often are recyclables collected?

The recyclables in the recycling bins in HDB estates are collected thrice a week, while the private landed properties are provided with weekly collection of recyclables and garden waste collection. Please refer to the table below for the collection frequencies of each PWC sector.

### 5. Who collects the recyclables in my estate?

It depends on where you stay. 
Under this programme launched in April 2001, the public waste collectors (PWCs) licensed by NEA are required to provide recycling bins and recycling collection services to all HDB estates, private landed properties and condominiums/private apartments opted into the public waste collection scheme.

### 6. What's the point of recycling? 

Recycling stops tonnes of rubbish being buried in landfill


### 7. Doesn't my recycling end up getting thrown away with the rubbish anyway?

This couldn’t be further from the truth! Your recycled material is a valuable resource. Once it has been collected (this includes recycling collected in the back of bin lorries) from your doorstep it's taken away to be sorted, bailed and then transported to reprocessors to be made into new products.
