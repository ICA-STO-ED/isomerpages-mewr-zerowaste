NEA has developed an Environmental Resource Kit to encourage and facilitate environmental stewardship among corporate organisations and NGOs. The resources in this toolkit will help organisations play their part for the environment, engage in environmental CSR, and save money. This resource kit provides information, resources, and activities that organisations can use to take meaningful action for the environment. Whether you are looking for ideas or resources to organise a group of volunteers for a one-time internal event, resource conservation initiatives within the organisation, or working with a team to educate and engage the wider community, this resource kit has what you need.
