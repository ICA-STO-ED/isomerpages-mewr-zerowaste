#### Share your views 

Over the years, Singapore has put in place an effective and efficient waste management system to safeguard our health and protect the environment. But our waste is growing at an unsustainable rate, as our population and economy grow. At the same time, climate change is putting increasing pressure on resources.

We invite you to contribute your views on how we can pursue more sustainable consumption and production, and build a strong culture of reducing, reusing and recycling. 

It will take a whole-of-nation effort to create the changes we need. Your views will help to shape our path towards a Zero Waste Nation, and lay the foundation for a sustainable environment for future generations. Together, we can build a better Singapore.
