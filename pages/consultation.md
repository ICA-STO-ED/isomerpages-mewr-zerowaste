Realising the ambitions of our Zero Waste Masterplan will require strong partnerships to co-create and implement new solutions. 

The government has been engaging stakeholders including companies, NGOs, research and educational institutions on our zero waste plans.  Earlier this year, the National Environment Agency consulted more than 250 companies on measures to address our key waste streams.  More than 1,300 respondents also took part in our online public consultation in March. This was followed by two focus group discussions in April which were co-organised with NGOs [Zero Waste Singapore](XX){:target="_blank"} and [Lepak In SG](XX){:target="_blank"}.



We thank you for your ideas and suggestions. The findings from the online consultation and the focus group discussions will help us formulate an actionable and sustainable Masterplan.

12        To support behaviour change, over 70 per cent of respondents also supported the redesign of labels on the blue recycling bins to provide more information on recycling. Currently, 40 per cent of what goes into our blue bins cannot be recycled because they are either non-recyclables, or because they have been contaminated by food or liquids. This is why “Recycle Right” will be the theme for our next focus group discussion on 29 April.

 

13        We are grateful to the respondents who took time to share their views with us. More than half made the effort to provide additional suggestions, which was helpful. For example, there were suggestions to encourage composting in the community. There were also suggestions on leveraging technology to optimize waste collection and understand waste habits.
