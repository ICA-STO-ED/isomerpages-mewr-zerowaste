### This will ensure e-waste is managed effectively and efficiently; consumers will also benefit from greater convenience in collection of e-waste

Building on existing voluntary e-waste recycling initiatives in Singapore, an e-waste management system will be established by 2021. Through the **Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR)** framework, responsibilities will be assigned to the key stakeholders in the e-waste value chain. 

Under the EPR framework, producers of covered electrical and electronic equipment will be required to take on responsibility for the collection and proper treatment of e-waste. These producers are companies that manufacture or import covered electrical and electronic equipment for supply on the local market.

For example, producers have to ensure that their products are properly recycled upon reaching their end of life, by fulfilling e-waste collection targets and channelling the e-waste collected to formal recyclers. 

As retailers are the touch points for consumers, the e-waste management system will also rope in retailers to provide convenient collection options for consumers.

Some of the e-waste types that will fall under the EPR framework include information and communications technology (ICT) equipment, solar photovoltaic panels, batteries and lamps, and certain household appliances. 

When producers are responsible for the ‘end-of-life’ of their products, they will be more incentivised to design products that are easily recycled, or come up with innovative circular business models to close their waste loop.
