### **Reuse Materials**

You can "reuse" materials in their original form instead of throwing them away, or pass those materials on to others who could use them too! Remember, one man's trash is another man's treasure! Here are some examples of reuse...

**Paper**
* Convert scrap paper into memo pads

**Plastic**
* Reuse medicine containers for travel toiletries
* Use unwanted plastic bags to contain household waste before displosal into refuse bins or chutes
*Use reusable bags when doing grocery shopping

**Glass**
* Reuse used glass containers as receptables

**Clothing**
* Use old clothing as rags for cleaning
* Pass on old clothing in good/usable condition to others

**Others**
* Reuse your mouse pad as an insulator for placing hot objects, or as a coaster
* Pass old textbooks, story books, and toys to others
* Repair and recondition faulty electronic appliances to extend their useful lives
* Clean and reuse ornaments for the next festive season
