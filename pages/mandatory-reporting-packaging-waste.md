### Mandatory Reporting of Packaging Waste

In 2017, 1.67 million tonnes of waste were disposed of by the domestic sector. Of this, about one-third is packaging waste. 

At the current rate of waste disposal, a new waste-to-energy plant is required to be built every seven to 10 years, and a new landfill is needed every 35 years. This is not sustainable given Singaporeâ€™s land constraints. Hence, it is important for everyone to play their part in minimising packaging waste.

Apart from e-waste, we are studying the feasibility of extending EPR to plastic and packaging waste. To start off, we will introduce a mandatory reporting framework for packaging data and waste reduction plans in 2020. Businesses such as brand owners, importers, large retailers and supermarkets will need to start collecting data on the types and amount of packaging they place in the market and submit plans for reduction.
