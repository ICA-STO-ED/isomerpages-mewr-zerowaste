### Mandatory Reporting of Packaging Waste

In 2017, 1.67 million tonnes of waste were disposed of by the domestic sector. Of this, about one-third is packaging waste. 

At the current rate of waste disposal, a new waste-to-energy plant is required to be built every seven to 10 years, and a new landfill is needed every 35 years. This is not sustainable given Singaporeâ€™s land constraints. Hence, it is important for everyone to play their part in minimising packaging waste.

Mandatory reporting is the first step towards sustainable packaging waste management. 

Under the mandatory reporting framework, companies that place packaging on the consumer market will be required to report information on the types and amounts of packaging they are placing on the market annually, and develop packaging waste reduction plans. 

The mandatory reporting framework will be implemented in 2020, beginning with the registration of businesses such as brand owners, importers and large retailers including supermarkets. These businesses will also be required to collect data on the types and amounts of packaging they place on the market and draw up plans for reducing the amount of packaging that will end up as waste for disposal.  

We are also studying the feasibility of extending the EPR framework to cover packaging waste, including plastics.
