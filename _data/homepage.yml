    section-subtitle: Citizens' Workgroup
    section-description: Close to 40% of what goes inside our blue recycling bins cannot be recycled. This is because people put in things that cannot be recycled or contaminate the recyclables with food and liquids. We're looking to partner with citizens to co-create solutions to address this recycling problem. Let's work together to recycle more and recycle right!
