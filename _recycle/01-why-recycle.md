### Recycling converts waste into useful products and conserves natural resources. It also reduces the need for incineration and extend the lifespan of Semakau Landfill

Recycling is a great way to protect the environment. Did you know that:

* Recycling 1,000kg of paper saves 17 trees.
* Recycling an aluminium can saves 95% of the energy used to make a new one.
* Recycling a glass bottle saves 30% of the energy used to make a new one.
 
### Our 2030 Recycling Targets

Of the waste generated in 2017, more than half - almost 4.72 million tonnes - was recycled. 

Even so, the recycling rate for households can still be improved. In 2016, only 21 per cent of waste produced by households was recycled. Under our 2030 recycling targets, we hope to increase this to 30 per cent by 2030.

Singapore has set a national recycling rate target of 70% in 2030, with 
* an increase in domestic recycling rate from 21% in 2016 to 30% in 2030, and 
* an increase for non-domestic recycling rate from 76% in 2016 to 81% in 2030.
