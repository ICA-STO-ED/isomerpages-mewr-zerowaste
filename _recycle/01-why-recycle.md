Of the waste generated in 2017, more than half - almost 4.72 million tonnes - was recycled. Even so, the amount of refuse sent for disposal has climbed over the years. 


We can all make a difference.

By recycling we reduce the need to use more natural resources.

By reducing our waste we decrease the need for more landfill.

By reusing more we can save money and reduce the need to consume and produce more waste.

You can make a difference!
