### 40% of materials placed inside the blue recycling bins are not suitable for recycling. These include food and liquid waste, which contaminate other recyclables.

Do remember to practise these steps of proper recycling!

**1. [Know what can or cannot be recycled](/recycle/what-to-recycle/)** 
* Do not deposit food waste and non-recyclables into recycling bins.
* Do not dispose bulky items like furniture and renovation waste at recycling bins.
* Single-use packaging such as disposable containers and cups often cannot be recycled as they are contaminated with food.

**2. Empty recyclable containers of their contents**
* For example, plastic takeaway food containers, shampoo/detergent bottles, canned/bottled drinks, cosmetic jars, jam jars etc

**3. Rinse and dry the containers when necessary**
* If containers are wet, greasy or contain food, they will contaminate the rest of the items in the recycling bin.

**4. Deposit recyclables into recycling bins**
