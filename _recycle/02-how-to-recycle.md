### 40% of materials placed inside our recycling bins are not suitable for recycling. These include food and liquid waste, which contaminate other recyclables.

Do remember to practise these steps of proper recycling!

**1. [Know what can or cannot be recycled](/recycle/what-to-recycle/)** 
* Do not deposit food waste and non-recyclables into recycling bins.
* Do not dispose bulky items like furniture and renovation waste at recycling bins.

**2. Empty recyclable containers of their contents**
* For example, food containers, shampoo/detergent bottles, canned drinks etc

**3. Rinse and dry the containers**
* If containers are wet, greasy or contain food scraps, they will contaminate the rest of the items in the recycling bin.

**4. Deposit recyclables into recycling bins**
