Remember to practise the 5 steps of proper recycling!

Recycle paper, plastic, metal, glass and old clothing

Empty recyclable containers of their contents

Deposit recyclables into recycling bins instead of leaving them outside.

Do not deposit food waste and non-recyclables into recycling bins.

Do not dispose bulky items like furniture and renovation waste at recycling bins.

Please contact NEA at 1800-CALL NEA (1800-2255 632) if you are unsure whether something is recyclable or not.
