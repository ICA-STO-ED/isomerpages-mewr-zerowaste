### 40% of materials placed inside our recycling bins are not suitable for recycling. Therese include food and liquid waste, which contaminate other recyclables.

Do remember to practise the 5 steps of proper recycling!

1. Know what can or cannot be recycled

2. Empty recyclable containers of their contents

3. Rinse and dry them 

4. Deposit recyclables into recycling bins.


Do not deposit food waste and non-recyclables into recycling bins.

Do not dispose bulky items like furniture and renovation waste at recycling bins.

Please contact NEA at 1800-CALL NEA (1800-2255 632) if you are unsure whether something is recyclable or not.
