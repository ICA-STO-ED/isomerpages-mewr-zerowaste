### 40% of materials placed inside the blue recycling bins are not suitable for recycling. These include food and liquid waste, which contaminate other recyclables.

Do remember to practise these steps of proper recycling!

**1. Use a bag or box to store your recyclables**
* Separate reusables (clothes, shoes, stuffed toys) from recyclables. Reusables that are in good condition should be donated. Find out where you can donate the reusables [here](https://www.facebook.com/MEWRsingapore/posts/2248425458541997){:target="_blank"}!

**2. [Know what can or cannot be recycled](/recycle/what-to-recycle/)** 
* Do not deposit food and liquid waste and non-recyclables into blue recycling bins.
* Do not dispose bulky items like furniture and renovation waste at recycling bins.
* Single-use packaging such as disposable containers and cups often cannot be recycled as they are contaminated with food.
* While [food waste](https://isomer-mewrzerowaste-staging.netlify.com/waste-streams/food-waste/) and [e-waste](/waste-streams/e-waste/) can be recycled, they cannot be deposited inside the blue recycling bins. Please refer to the respective waste stream pages to find out how they can recycled.

**3. Empty recyclable containers of their contents**
* For example, plastic takeaway food containers, shampoo/detergent bottles, canned/bottled drinks, cosmetic jars, jam jars etc

**4. Rinse and dry the containers when necessary**
* If containers are wet, greasy or contain food, they will contaminate the rest of the items in the recycling bin. Give these containers a simple rinse before you put them into the blue bin.

**5. Deposit recyclables into recycling bins**

Remember, there's no need to sort different types of recyclables for the blue bins because they will be [sorted centrally](/recycle/what-happens-to-recyclables/).
