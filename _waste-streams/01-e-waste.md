### Singapore generates about 60,000 tonnes of e-waste a year. That’s equivalent to discarding about 73 mobile phones per person in Singapore! This number is expected to increase with greater spending power and new technologies constantly replacing old ones. 

![What is e-waste](/images/ewastebanner.jpg)

E-waste refers to electrical and electronic waste, such as computers, laptops, mobile phones and TVs. While these items can often be refurbished, repaired or recycled, they are usually discarded instead. Not only does e-waste contain valuable and scarce materials, there are also small amounts of harmful substances that could potentially harm our environment and health if not handled properly.

When e-waste is disposed of and incinerated, it results in the loss of resources as well as carbon emissions that contribute to global warming and climate change. E-waste also contains small amounts of heavy metals. Hence, recycling our e-waste reduces the amount of heavy metals in our incineration ash. 

### Prevention is better than cure 

Approaching the topic of e-waste with the right mentality is key. Start by asking yourself before each purchase: “*Do I really need this*?”. If the item is indeed something you cannot do without, the next question is if you can reduce on your carbon footprint, such as the following:

*“Do I need a brand new one, or will a second-hand option fulfil my needs?”*
*“How often will I use this? Could I borrow the item from my neighbour?”*
*“Are there reusable options (such as rechargeable batteries) that I can consider?”*

There are many ways we can save the Earth; all we need to do is to pause and consider our options. 

### What about existing electronic products at home? 

There are various ways you can reduce e-waste as an individual or family:

#### 1. Repair electrical and electronic equipment (EEE) where feasible

Instead of throwing away a faulty EEE, you can send it for repair or learn how to repair them yourself. Not only does repairing your own items give you a sense of accomplishment; it helps you save money and protect the environment! 

If fixing things isn’t your forte, but you want to combat the buy-and-throw-away culture in Singapore, check out Repair Kopitiam where Repair Coaches can help with salvaging your faulty items.  


#### 2. Reuse/donate items in working condition

You may not have use for the EEE item anymore, but that does not mean it is of no use to others! 

If you feel like you’ve had the item for some time and would like a change, why not pass the old one to someone who needs it? Donating EEE for reuse prolongs their lives and thus conserves our natural resources.

#### 3. Recycle e-waste 

![how to recycle e-waste](/images/recycleewaste.jpg)

If the item is broken and can no longer be repaired or used, materials such as gold, silver, copper and plastics can still be recovered and made into new products. Simply drop the item off at a recycling point, so that some of the materials can still be used instead of being incinerated. This simple act reduces the amount of new materials being used. 

#### How to recycle your e-waste?

The best way to dispose off e-waste is through e-waste recycling programmes. This ensures that the items are sent to recycling facilities that dismantle and recycle e-waste in an environmentally-friendly manner. E-waste also comprises many different components, and these facilities can also extract the maximum amount of recyclable materials from e-waste using specialised equipment.
