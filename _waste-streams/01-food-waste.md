<a name="why"></a>
#### Why is this a problem? 

Food waste accounts for about 10% of total waste generated in Singapore and only 16% was recycled in 2017.

Food waste makes up about half of the average 1.5kg of waste disposed of by each household in Singapore daily. Yet, more than half of household food waste can be prevented, of which rice, noodles and bread are the most common.


**What is avoidable food waste?**

![Examples of avoidable food waste](/images/avoidable-food-waste.jpg)

Avoidable food waste refers to food items that could have been consumed if better managed. Examples of avoidable food waste are leftovers from a meal, expired food, stale food, and blemished fruits and vegetables. Avoidable food waste can be prevented by taking food wastage reduction actions such as buying, ordering and cooking only what is needed and adopting smart food storage and preparation practices. 

Conversely, unavoidable food waste are parts/portions of food which were not intended for consumption, such as such as bones and egg shells.

**What happens when you waste food?**

When food is wasted, more food has to be sourced to meet the food demand and this affects our food security since Singapore imports over 90% of our food supply.  

Increasing amount of food waste puts pressure on our resources. We will need to build more waste disposal facilities, such as waste-to-energy plants and landfills for incineration ash. This is not sustainable for land-scarce Singapore.

When food is wasted, so are all of the resources used to grow and deliver the food to our tables, as well as to dispose of it. This increases our carbon footprint, contributing to global warming and climate change.

#### What is the government doing? 

**For Consumers:**

* Ongoing [Food Waste Reduction Outreach Programme](https://www.nea.gov.sg/our-services/waste-management/3r-programmes-and-resources/food-waste-management/food-waste-management-strategies){:target="_blank"} to encourage consumers to adopt smart purchasing, storage and preparation habits that help save money and reduce food waste. Various collaterals have been developed for the campaign, including a food wastage reduction guide for households, educational outreach through skits, cooking demos, roadshow engagements.

* Conducted a [Household Waste Study](https://www.nea.gov.sg/media/news/news/index/saving-money-the-biggest-motivation-for-households-to-reduce-food-wastage-nea-ava-survey-2015-11-20){:target="_blank"} (Nov 16 to Mar 17) to obtain quantitative data on food waste disposed of by households. Information used to aid development of food waste reduction programmes in Singapore.

* Embarked on household food waste segregation pilot (‘Food Waste? Don’t Waste!’ pilot) at Tampines Greenlace from August to November 2018. 

**For Schools:**

* Ongoing [Love Your Food @ Schools](https://www.nea.gov.sg/media/news/index/nea-launches-love-your-food-@-schools-project-to-encourage-youth-to-cherish-and-not-waste-food) project at 10 schools to encourage students and staff to reduce the amount of food waste they generate and to garner the participation of students, staff and canteen stall holders to segregate their food waste for treatment using on-site food waste digesters.

**For Corporates (e.g. commercial and industrial premises):**

* Developed Food Waste Minimisation Guidebooks for [Food Retail Establishments](https://form.sg/#!/forms/nea/5a93692b86434f006f9f9b60)/ [Food Manufacturing Establishments](https://form.sg/#!/forms/nea/5a936cef86434f006f9fa26e)/ [Supermarkets](https://form.sg/#!/forms/nea/5a936d8686434f006f9fa32a) with AVA

* Installed food waste treatment systems at 4 hawker centres - Block 628 Ang Mo Kio Ave 4 Market and Food Centre, Our Tampines Hub Hawker Centre, Jurong West Hawker Centre and Yishun Park Hawker Centre (as of Sep 2018)

* Collected source-segregated food waste from various premises since Dec 2016 for transportation to a demonstration facility, where the food waste is co-digested with used water sludge.

* Supported 24 premises, including hotels, malls and educational institutions, to install on-site food waste treatment systems under NEA’s 3R Fund. 

* Developed standards on food waste management for food processing/manufacturing establishments (completed) and food retail and wholesale/distribution establishments (in progress) with SMF-SDO

#### What can you do as an individual

Here are 5 simple tips to minimise food wastage. 

**1. Plan your purchases**

![Plan your food purchases](/images/plan-your-purchase1.jpg)

24% of households threw away spoilt or rotten food because they either bought too much food or did not realise that they had food hidden at the back of their fridge. 

![Plan your food purchases](/images/plan-your-purchase2.jpg)

Before going grocery shopping, make a shopping list of things you need so you won’t overbuy. Don’t forget to check your fridge and cabinet so you don’t end up buying things you already have. Not only will this minimise food waste, you won’t overspend too. ;)


**2. Practise “first to expire, first out”**

![First in, first out](/images/expired-food.jpg)

It is always good to properly label all your food products, and store them according to the ‘First Expire First Out’ (FEFO) principle. This means placing food products nearer to their expiry dates at the front of the fridge or cabinet, which would remind you to use them as soon as possible, minimising unnecessary food wastage. 


**3. Follow storage instructions**

![storage instructions](/images/storage-instructions.jpg)

Storage requirements differ from product to product, so be sure to read the instructions before putting them away! Storage instructions are often indicated on the product’s packaging by the manufacturer. 


**4. Cook just enough**

![cook just enough](/images/cook-just-enough.jpg)

Find out who’s coming home for dinner and plan how much food to cook accordingly. If you plan on cooking a variety of dishes for your family, downsize the portions to avoid wasting food. Also, don’t get distracted while cooking…you wouldn’t want the food to get burnt and have to be thrown away!


**5. Make use of leftovers for the next meal**

![leftovers](/images/leftovers.jpg)

Instead of throwing away your leftovers, turn them into tasty new dishes. Learn how to cook up a storm using common leftover ingredients with recipes for bread pudding pancake, spicy ribs udon, Hawaiian chicken swirls and more, here.


**2. Donate excess food**

![donate excess food](/images/donate-excess-food.jpg)

Donate excess food to the needy via organisations such as the [Food Bank Singapore](http://www.foodbank.sg){:target="_blank"} , [Food from the Heart](https://foodheart.org){:target="_blank"} , [Fei Yue Community Services](http://www.fcys.org){:target="_blank"}  and [Willing Hearts](http://www.willinghearts.org.sg){:target="_blank"} .

#### What can you do as a business
### Retailers and manufacturers can help too!

**1. Offer different portion sizes options and indicate serving sizes**

![smaller portions](/images/smaller-portions.jpg)

Food retail establishments and supermarkets can help reduce food wastage by offering different portion sizes and indicate serving sizes for consumers. This gives consumers an option to buy and order just the right amount of food for themselves, instead of having to purchase one standard size. 

![small medium large](/images/SML.jpg)

Food manufacturers can also help by packing food into smaller portions to cater to smaller families. This not only helps reduce food wastage due to overbuying, but also allows for preservation of freshness.
