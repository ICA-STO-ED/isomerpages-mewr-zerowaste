#### Why is this a problem? 

Food waste makes up about half of the average 1.5kg of waste disposed of by each household in Singapore daily. Yet, more than half of household food waste can be prevented, of which rice, noodles and bread are the most common.


**What is avoidable food waste?**

![Examples of avoidable food waste](/images/avoidable-food-waste.jpg)

Avoidable food waste refers to food items that could have been consumed if better managed. Examples of avoidable food waste are leftovers from a meal, expired food, stale food, and blemished fruits and vegetables. Avoidable food waste can be prevented by taking food wastage reduction actions such as buying, ordering and cooking only what is needed and adopting smart food storage and preparation practices. 

Conversely, unavoidable food waste are parts/portions of food which were not intended for consumption, such as such as bones and egg shells.

**What happens when you waste food?**

When food is wasted, more food has to be sourced to meet the food demand and this affects our food security since Singapore imports over 90% of our food supply.  

Increasing amount of food waste puts pressure on our resources. We will need to build more waste disposal facilities, such as waste-to-energy plants and landfills for incineration ash. This is not sustainable for land-scarce Singapore.

When food is wasted, so are all of the resources used to grow and deliver the food to our tables, as well as to dispose of it. This increases our carbon footprint, contributing to global warming and climate change.

#### What can you do as an individual?

Here are 3 simple tips to minimise food wastage. 

**1. Buy, order and cook only what you can finish**

![Plan your food purchases](/images/plan-your-purchase1.jpg)

24% of households threw away spoilt or rotten food because they either bought too much food or did not realise that they had food hidden at the back of their fridge. 

![Plan your food purchases](/images/plan-your-purchase2.jpg)

Before going grocery shopping, make a shopping list of things you need so you won’t overbuy. Don’t forget to check your fridge and cabinet so you don’t end up buying things you already have. Not only will this minimise food waste, you won’t overspend too. 

![cook just enough](/images/cook-just-enough.jpg)

Find out who’s coming home for dinner and plan how much food to cook accordingly. If you plan on cooking a variety of dishes for your family, downsize the portions to avoid wasting food. 


**2. Turn leftovers into new dishes**

![leftovers](/images/leftovers.jpg)

Instead of throwing away your leftovers, turn them into tasty new dishes. Learn how to cook up a storm using common leftover ingredients with recipes for bread pudding pancake, spicy ribs udon, Hawaiian chicken swirls and more, [here](https://www.cgs.sg/FWRguide){:target="_blank"}

**3. Donate your excess food**

![donate excess food](/images/donate-excess-food.jpg)

Donate excess food to the needy via organisations such as the [Food Bank Singapore](http://www.foodbank.sg){:target="_blank"} , [Food from the Heart](https://foodheart.org){:target="_blank"} , [Fei Yue Community Services](http://www.fcys.org){:target="_blank"}  and [Willing Hearts](http://www.willinghearts.org.sg){:target="_blank"} .

#### What can you do as a business?

Retailers and manufacturers can help too!

**1. Offer different portion sizes options and indicate serving sizes**

![smaller portions](/images/smaller-portions.jpg)

Food retail establishments and supermarkets can help reduce food wastage by offering different portion sizes and indicate serving sizes for consumers. This gives consumers an option to buy and order just the right amount of food for themselves, instead of having to purchase one standard size. 

![small medium large](/images/SML.jpg)

Food manufacturers can also help by packing food into smaller portions to cater to smaller families. This not only helps reduce food wastage due to overbuying, but also allows for preservation of freshness.
