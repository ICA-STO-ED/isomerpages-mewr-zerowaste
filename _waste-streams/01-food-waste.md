### Food waste is one of the biggest waste streams in Singapore and the amount of food waste generated has grown by around 40% over the last 10 years. 810 million kg of food waste was generated in 2017 – that’s the weight of more than 55,000 double decker buses.

#### Why is this a problem? 

Food waste makes up about half of the average 1.5kg of waste disposed of by each household in Singapore daily. Of which, more than half of household food waste can be prevented, with rice, noodles and bread being the most commonly wasted food items.


**What is avoidable food waste?**

![Examples of avoidable food waste](/images/avoidable-food-waste.jpg)

Avoidable food waste refers to food items that could have been consumed if better managed. Examples of avoidable food waste are leftovers from a meal, expired food, stale food, and blemished fruits and vegetables. Avoidable food waste can be prevented by taking food wastage reduction actions such as buying, ordering and cooking only what is needed and adopting smart food storage and preparation practices. 

Conversely, unavoidable food waste are parts/portions of food which were not intended for consumption, such as such as bones and egg shells.

**What happens when you waste food?**

When food is wasted, more food has to be sourced to meet the food demand and this affects our food security since Singapore imports over 90% of our food supply.  

Increasing amount of food waste puts pressure on our resources. We will need to build more waste disposal facilities, such as waste-to-energy plants and landfills for incineration ash. This is not sustainable for land-scarce Singapore.

When food is wasted, so are all of the resources used to grow and deliver the food to our tables, as well as to dispose of it. This increases our carbon footprint, contributing to global warming and climate change.

#### What can you do as an individual?

Here are 3 simple tips to minimise food wastage. 

**1. Buy, order and cook only what you can finish**

![Plan your food purchases](/images/plan-your-purchase1.jpg)

24% of households often threw away spoilt or rotten food because they either bought too much food or did not realise that they had food hidden at the back of their fridge. 

![Plan your food purchases](/images/plan-your-purchase2.jpg)

Before going grocery shopping, make a shopping list of things you need so you won’t overbuy. Don’t forget to check your fridge and cabinet so you don’t end up buying things you already have. Not only will this minimise food waste, you won’t overspend too. 

![cook just enough](/images/cook-just-enough.jpg)

Find out who’s coming home for dinner and plan how much food to cook accordingly. If you plan on cooking a variety of dishes for your family, downsize the portions to avoid wasting food. 


**2. Turn leftovers into new dishes**

![leftovers](/images/leftovers.jpg)

Instead of throwing away your leftovers, turn them into tasty new dishes. Learn how to cook up a storm using common leftover ingredients with recipes for bread pudding pancake, spicy ribs udon, Hawaiian chicken swirls and more, [here](https://www.cgs.sg/FWRguide){:target="_blank"}

**3. Donate your excess food**

![donate excess food](/images/donate-excess-food.jpg)

Donate excess food to the needy via organisations such as the [Food Bank Singapore](http://www.foodbank.sg){:target="_blank"} , [Food from the Heart](https://foodheart.org){:target="_blank"} , [Fei Yue Community Services](http://www.fcys.org){:target="_blank"}  and [Willing Hearts](http://www.willinghearts.org.sg){:target="_blank"} .

#### What can you do as a business?

Retailers and manufacturers can help too!

**1. Offer different portion sizes options and indicate serving sizes**

![smaller portions](/images/smaller-portions.jpg)

Food retail establishments and supermarkets can help reduce food wastage by offering different portion sizes and indicate serving sizes for consumers. This gives consumers an option to buy and order just the right amount of food for themselves, instead of having to purchase one standard size. 

![small medium large](/images/SML.jpg)

Food manufacturers can also help by packing food into smaller portions to cater to smaller families. This not only helps reduce food wastage due to overbuying, but also allows for preservation of freshness. 

Also, don’t forget to check out to check out the food waste minimisation guidebooks for Food Manufacturing Establishments, Food Retail Establishments and Supermarkets at the NEA Food Waste Management webpage [here](https://www.nea.gov.sg/our-services/waste-management/3r-programmes-and-resources/food-waste-management){:target="_blank"} .

##### What are others doing?

* [Food from the Heart](www.foodfromtheheart.sg){:target="_blank"} started a Clean Plate Campaign in schools to raise awareness of the environmental and societal impact of food waste. Through the campaign, Clean Plate Ambassadors will visit the schools to share with pupils the message of not wasting food and to inculcate habits of mindful eating.

* [SG Food Rescue](https://www.facebook.com/groups/sgfoodrescue/){:target="_blank"} brings together people who are passionate about reducing food waste in Singapore. Their main priority is food rescue. They redistribute unwanted food to whoever is willing to consume it, not just to the needy. 

* Foodprints @ South West - an initiative by the South West Community Development Council - is a first-in-Singapore labelling programme that aims to recognise schools, hotels, retail establishments and other organisations in the South West District that have taken steps to reduce the amount of food waste generated. Measures include designing food waste reduction posters which will be displayed around their school, and educating canteen food operators on good food management and storage practices.

* Community fridges have appeared in Queenstown, Yishun and Tampines. Donors are encouraged to leave fresh food produce in the fridge. Anyone who needs help to put food on the table can just help themselves and take what they need.

* [treatsure](https://www.treatsure.co/){:target="_blank"} is Singapore's first mobile reservation platform connecting businesses & hotels with surplus food to everyday consumers. Through their mobile app, treatsure shares and reallocates excess food resources to people who would treasure them, minimising food wastage.

* [Tree Dots](https://www.thetreedots.com/){:target="_blank"} aims to reduce the amount of food waste by creating a marketplace to link people with unsold inventory to potential buyers so as to not let them end up in the bin.
