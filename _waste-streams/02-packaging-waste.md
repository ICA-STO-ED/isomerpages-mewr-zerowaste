### Of the 1.6 million tonnes of domestic waste disposed of in 2017, packaging consists of one-third. There is potential to further reduce packaging waste.

Carbonated beverages, chilled juice, fresh milk, cooking oil, dishwashing liquid - all these items come with packaging. 





A life-cycle assessment study commissioned by the NEA showed that different materials have different environmental impacts. Therefore, promoting certain types of materials over others, may not be better for the environment.

A more sustainable approach would be to tackle the excessive consumption of all types of single-use packaging. 

Single-use packaging such as disposable containers and cups often cannot be recycled as they are contaminated with food.
