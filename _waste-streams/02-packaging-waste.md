Packaging waste is a large waste stream, making up one-third of domestic waste disposed of. There is potential to further reduce packaging waste.

A life-cycle assessment study commissioned by the NEA showed that different materials have different environmental impacts. Therefore, promoting certain types of materials over others, may not be better for the environment.

A more sustainable approach would be to tackle the excessive consumption of all types of single-use packaging. 

Single-use packaging such as disposable containers and cups often cannot be recycled as they are contaminated with food.
