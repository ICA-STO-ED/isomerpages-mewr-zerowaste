### Of the 1.6 million tonnes of domestic waste disposed of in 2017, one-third is made up of packaging. Most of this packaging is made of plastic, but only 6% of plastic waste is recycled.

#### Why is this a problem? 

Most packaging for consumer goods, such as food, drinks, cleaning products, shampoo etc is used just once before being thrown away.

Unnecessary packaging is not only a drain on resources, it is also adds to the production of waste. Given the lack of space for another landfill in Singapore, we need to reduce the amount of waste we produce to prolong the lifespan of our landfill for as long as we can.

### A waste of resources

Many people and companies simply throw packaging away without a thought, especially if the packaging was not designed to be reused or easily recycled.

Often, elaborate packaging is also used to make products appear more attractive. Consumers can help change wasteful practices by choosing products that have less packaging.


A life-cycle assessment study commissioned by the NEA showed that different materials have different environmental impacts. Therefore, promoting certain types of materials over others, may not be better for the environment.

A more sustainable approach would be to tackle the excessive consumption of all types of single-use packaging. 

Single-use packaging such as disposable containers and cups often cannot be recycled as they are contaminated with food.

Singapore Packaging Agreement

We are working with industry partners and NGOs through the [Singapore Packaging Agreement](https://www.nea.gov.sg/programmes-grants/schemes/singapore-packaging-agreement){:target="_blank"} to reduce packaging waste. Companies which sign the voluntary Agreement commit to reducing their packaging waste over a period of five years. They do this by redesigning their production processes, reducing the size and thickness of the physical packaging produced, eliminating unnecessary packaging, and changing the way that products are packaged. Since the SPA was introduced in 2007, member companies have collectively reduced 46,000 tonnes of packaging.
