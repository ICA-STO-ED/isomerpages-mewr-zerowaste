Food waste makes up about half of the average 1.5kg of waste disposed of by each household in Singapore daily. Yet, more than half of household food waste can be prevented, of which rice, noodles and bread are the most common.

### What is avoidable food waste?

![Examples of avoidable food waste](/images/avoidable-food-waste.jpg)

Avoidable food waste refers to food items that could have been consumed if better managed. Examples of avoidable food waste are leftovers from a meal, expired food, stale food, and blemished fruits and vegetables. Avoidable food waste can be prevented by taking food wastage reduction actions such as buying, ordering and cooking only what is needed and adopting smart food storage and preparation practices. 

Conversely, unavoidable food waste are parts/portions of food which were not intended for consumption, such as such as bones and egg shells.

Food for thought: Why has the amount of food waste generated in Singapore increased over the past 10 years if most of the food waste could have been prevented?

### How can we minimise food wastage?

Here are 5 simple tips to minimise food wastage. 

**1. Plan your purchases**

![Plan your food purchases](/images/plan-your-purchase1.jpg)

24% of households threw away spoilt or rotten food because they either bought too much food or did not realise that they had food hidden at the back of their fridge.

Before going grocery shopping, make a shopping list of things you need so you won’t overbuy. Don’t forget to check your fridge and cabinet so you don’t end up buying things you already have. Not only will this minimise food waste, you won’t overspend too. ;)


**2. Practise “first to expire, first out”**

It is always good to properly label all your food products, and store them according to the ‘First Expire First Out’ (FEFO) principle. This means placing food products nearer to their expiry dates at the front of the fridge or cabinet, which would remind you to use them as soon as possible, minimising unnecessary food wastage. 


**3. Follow storage instructions**

Storage requirements differ from product to product, so be sure to read the instructions before putting them away! Storage instructions are often indicated on the product’s packaging by the manufacturer. 


**4. Cook just enough**

Find out who’s coming home for dinner and plan how much food to cook accordingly. If you plan on cooking a variety of dishes for your family, downsize the portions to avoid wasting food. Also, don’t get distracted while cooking…you wouldn’t want the food to get burnt and have to be thrown away!


**5. Make use of leftovers for the next meal**

### Retailers and manufacturers can help too!

**1. Offer different portion sizes options and indicate serving sizes**

Food retail establishments and supermarkets can help reduce food wastage by offering different portion sizes and indicate serving sizes for consumers. This gives consumers an option to buy and order just the right amount of food for themselves, instead of having to purchase one standard size.

Food manufacturers can also help by packing food into smaller portions to cater to smaller families. This not only helps reduce food wastage due to overbuying, but also allows for preservation of freshness. 


**2. Donate excess food**
