### 40% of what goes into recycling bins cannot be recycled. These include food and liquid waste, which contaminate other recyclables.

#### Why is this a problem? 


Contamination arises when wrong things are thrown into the blue recycling bin, such as food and liquid waste as well as items that cannot be recycled.

When this happens, this will contaminated the rest of the recyclables collected and waste the efforts of everyone. 

If recyclables get contaminated by food or liquid waste, they're no different from general waste. They will then have been disposed of, incinerated and landfilled. 

That's why putting the right stuff in the right bin is important. 

While the recycling rate for the non-domestic sector has been high, our domestic recycling rate has grown only gradually, to 21% in 2017.

#### What is the government doing? 

We are making it easier for residents to recycle in order to increase the domestic recycling rate to 30% by 2030, which is one of the targets of our Sustainable Singapore Blueprint. 

Infrastructure has been put in place to make recycling more convenient. Since 2014, every HDB block has been provided with a blue recycling bin - up from one bin for every five blocks. There are also dual chutes for refuse and recyclables in all new HDB flats and non-landed private residential developments.

We will also use regulatory measures to complement the new recycling infrastructure. For example, we will introduce a new framework to make it easier for Singaporeans to [recycle their e-waste](/waste-streams/e-waste/).

This year, we will also launch the #RecycleRight movement to encourage Singaporeans to recycle right. For example, recycling bin labels will be redesigned to make it clearer [what can or cannot be recycled](/recycle/what-to-recycle/).
