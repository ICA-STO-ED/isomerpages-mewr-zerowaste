Recycling in Singapore is simple - you don't even have to pre-sort your recyclables before putting them in the blue bin as sorting will be done at a central facility after all the recyclables have been collected. ♻️ Find out more from Denise Keller!

All you need to do is to make sure you put the right stuff in the right bin. Check the label on the blue recycling bin if you are unsure what can or cannot be recycled! 

Watch the video with Denise Keller to find out more.
