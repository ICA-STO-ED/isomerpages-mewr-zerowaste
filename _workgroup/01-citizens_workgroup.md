### How can we get households to recycle more? What can we do to reduce the contamination rate of our recycling bins?

These are some of the issues we are looking to address with the Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources (MEWR)'s inaugural #RecycleRight Citizens’ Workgroup. 

The first two sessions of the Citizens’ Workgroup were held on 21 and 22 September with 48 members from diverse backgrounds. Our aim is to co-create practical solutions with this diverse group of citizens to improve the way households recycle in Singapore.

Prior to the kick-off, all workgroup participants were invited to visit the Materials Recovery Facility to learn more about the recycling process. Participants were also given access to background information about household recycling in Singapore, including statistics from our household recycling surveys. 

Through this Citizens’ Workgroup process, participants will need to work with one another to investigate various solutions, and reach a group consensus on the recommendations to submit to the Ministry. To help the group with the piloting and implementation of solutions, participants were also matched with resource persons who can share their expertise. 

Through the Citizens’ Workgroup, we aim to go beyond consulting citizens, to working together with citizens. After the sessions are over, we encourage participants to continue working with us and our partners to make their recommendations a reality, and to encourage others to participate as well.
