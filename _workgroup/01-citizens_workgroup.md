### How can we improve household recycling?

![image of recycle bin](/images/Hm_workgroup.jpg)

This was the question posed to members of public who signed up to join the Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources’ (MEWR) inaugural Citizens’ Workgroup.

From 21 September to 20 October 2019, more than 40 citizens from diverse backgrounds worked together to co-create solutions to improve the way households recycle in Singapore.

The Workgroup members were provided with the following to facilitate their discussions:

·       Visit to a Materials Recovery Facility

·       Access to background information about household recycling in Singapore, including statistics from household recycling surveys

·       Access to subject matter experts

·       Access to funding of materials required for testing of ideas.

The members of the Citizens’ Workgroup have submitted their recommendations to MEWR. MEWR will provide a response to their recommendations by end of November 2019.

Watch this space for the members’ final report and MEWR’s response!
