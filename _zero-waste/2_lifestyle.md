### The amount of waste we generate is not sustainable and is contributing to climate change.



Living a zero waste lifestyle is not just about limiting yourself to a mason jar of trash in a year. It's about being mindful about what you consume, taking steps to avoid unnecessary waste and reducing the amount of trash you produce.

Ultimately, zero waste is a goal that we strive for. It is not a destination, but a journey.

While the government and businesses can only do so much, we hope that more individuals will become personally committed to living a â€œzero waste 3R lifestyle" and learn to love and to take care of our environment.
