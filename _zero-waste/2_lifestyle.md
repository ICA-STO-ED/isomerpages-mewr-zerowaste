### The amount of waste we generate is not sustainable and is contributing to climate change.

The zero waste movement is gradually gaining traction in Singapore, as more and more individuals become aware of the impact that their actions have on earth. 

While you don’t have to go right to zero (or limit yourself to a mason jar of trash in a year), there are small, simple steps you can take to avoid unnecessary waste and reduce the amount of trash you produce.

Is Zero Waste really possible at home? It all starts with purchasing decisions, proper planning and setting up a system for what and how materials enter your home in the first place.

While the government and businesses can only do so much, we hope that more individuals will become personally committed to living a “zero waste 3R lifestyle" and learn to love and to take care of our environment.


### How you can help:
* Reduce waste [Be a responsible consumer, reduce and reuse]
* Recycle more and recycle right [No food or liquids in the blue bin]

Make 2019 the year you join the zero waste journey!
