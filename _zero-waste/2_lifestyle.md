### The amount of waste we generate is not sustainable and is contributing to climate change.

How you can help:
1)     Reduce waste [Be a responsible consumer, reduce and reuse]
2)     Recycle more and recycle right [No food or liquids in the blue bin]


Make 2019 the year you join the zero waste journey! 






### Your role as an individual

Government and businesses can only do so much. We cannot legislate desirable behaviour – we need to change societal norms and people’s mindsets, so that individuals are personally committed to living a “zero waste 3R lifestyle”.
We must raise awareness among the public to love and to take care of our environment.
