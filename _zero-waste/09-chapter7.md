### Our zero waste vision is an endeavour that will require people in Singapore to come together. From individuals to households and industries, everyone has a part to play as we make our transition towards a Zero Waste Nation.

<caption>2019 was designated as the Year Towards Zero Waste to rally Singaporeans to care for our environment
and treasure our precious resources</caption>

To become a Zero Waste Nation, we need to
change the way we live, work and play. This
includes curbing excessive consumption
habits in all aspects of our lives, harvesting
trash for treasure, consciously choosing
sustainable products and services, and
reusing resources for as long as possible.

The Government has set the direction of this
transformation and taken significant steps
to chart its course. We have facilitated the
setting up of infrastructure to collect, sort and
recycle different types of items and materials,
and have stepped up education to change
attitudes and behaviours towards reducing,
reusing and recycling.

But the Government cannot do this alone. We
need to partner businesses, individuals and
organisations to come up with innovative and
effective solutions. Over the years, MEWR and
the NEA have worked closely with partners
to undertake collective action for sustainable
development. As we embark on this
transformational journey together, we want to
uncover broader perspectives, listen to diverse
views, and bring together different segments of
society to co-create environmental solutions.
