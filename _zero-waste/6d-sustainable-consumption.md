### Sustainable consumption

Rising disposable income levels have
led to more comfortable lives for current
generations. But as our affluence grows, so
does our consumption of goods and services.
This in turn generates waste, with the amount
of waste disposed of in Singapore increasing
by over seven times over the last 40 years.

How we consume is influenced by social
norms, such as pressure to over-order food at
meals, keep up with fashion trends, or get the
latest mobile phone model.

To promote more sustainable consumption,
we need to do more and better with less. This
can be achieved by having a reduce and reuse
mindset, and by shifting towards the use of
green products.

#### REDUCE

To reduce waste, we need to be conscious
consumers, mindful of the materials and
energy poured into every product or meal.

**The ongoing fight to curb food waste**

The battle to cut food waste is intensifying,
with more organisations joining hands
to spread the message of sustainable
consumption.

The NEA launched a food waste reduction
publicity and outreach programme in
November 2015 to raise awareness of
Singapore’s food waste situation and
encourage consumers to adopt smart food
purchase, storage and preparation habits to
help them minimise food wastage.

Informational advertisements and
educational videos on practical ways to
reduce food waste were featured on various
mass media platforms to reach the public.
A comprehensive handy guide was also
developed and made available online and
distributed at community events. It provided
tips on reducing food waste in different
scenarios, such as when cooking at home,
eating out or organising events.

The NEA has been ramping up engagement
efforts, such as talks, food waste reduction
demonstrations and other activities with
support from the Food Waste Reduction
Ambassadors (FWRAs) programme. To date,
more than 400 ambassadors have been
trained to help spread the word on food waste
reduction to their communities, families
and friends.

<caption>The NEA’s food waste reduction publicity and outreach programme was launched in November 2015. In 2019, the key message was to encourage everyone to “Buy, Order or Cook Just Enough”</caption>

Four years on, as part of the 2019 Year
Towards Zero Waste, the NEA partnered 25
hawker centres and organisations such as
Dairy Farm Singapore, NTUC FairPrice, Prime
Supermarket and Sheng Siong Supermarket,
as well as schools and Institutes of Higher
Learning, to engage consumers at points-ofconsumption.

Together, they promote three key actions that
consumers can adopt to reduce food waste
– order only what you can finish, ask for less
rice or noodles if you cannot finish them and
to say “no” to side dishes you will not eat.

Among the campaign’s features were visual
reminders, such as wobblers, table-top
stickers, wallscapes and pillar wraps, and
an edutainment web series that inspires
viewers to incorporate food waste reduction
practices into their day-to-day lives.

![Launch of Say YES To Waste Less campaign at IKEA Tampines](/images/ch2_sayyestowasteless_campaign.jpg)

launched by Senior Minister of State for the Environment and Water Resources, Dr Amy Khor</caption>

**Tackling single-use disposables**

Just as important is the need to address the
problem of disposables that are often used
for only a short period before being thrown
away.

The Say YES to Waste Less campaign was
launched on 8 June 2019 to build public
awareness on excessive consumption, the
impact on Singapore’s environment and future
generations, and the need for reduction.

With the campaign message, “Make the Right
Choice. Choose Reusables”, consumers were
encouraged to take simple, actionable steps to
reduce their impact on the environment. They
could start simply by using a reusable bottle,
bag or food container instead of disposables.

At its launch, the campaign brought
together 59 partners, with support from
over 1,600 outlets and premises from
across the F&B, retail, commercial and
community sectors. These partners helped
to nudge consumers to make the right
choice at points of consumption using a
wide range of initiatives. These included
visual reminders at cashier points, training
of cashiers and providing incentives for
using reusables.

The campaign also included district events
and 100 roadshows in collaboration with
the community to build awareness and
encourage action.

To further reduce the use of disposables,
the NEA disallowed their use for dine-in
at new hawker centres such as at Our
Tampines Hub, Pasir Ris Central and
Yishun Park. The NEA has also extended
this requirement to new stallholders
operating in existing hawker centres.

There has also been increasing support from
the private sector to tackle the excessive
use of disposables. Several F&B retail
outlets such as KFC Singapore, Burger King
Singapore and Resorts World Sentosa no
longer provide plastic straws at their outlets.
Yakult Singapore also started selling its
probiotic cultured milk drink without straws.

Packaging-free grocery stores have also
emerged, where packaging is eliminated.
They encourage customers to bring their
own containers, and allow them to buy what
they need instead of a pre-packaged amount.
These stores also offer more competitive
prices as going without packaging reduces
the cost of its products by an estimated
10%, allowing customers to save both the
environment and money.

consumption consciousness so that customers only buy what they need. This also provides fresher food items while
generating less packaging and food waste. Another core objective of UnPackt is to educate the public about zero
waste through workshops, community outreach with schools and corporations, and collaborations with like-minded
social enterprises. Photo: UnPackt Pte Ltd</caption>

#### REUSE AND DONATE

How often have you thrown away a pair of
jeans still in mint condition because it no
longer fits, or a rice cooker that broke down
after just a couple of months?

Often, these items can be repaired, donated
or sold second-hand. We want to establish
a habit of reuse in the community, such that
we will not easily discard unwanted or faulty
products.

To promote the repair trade, the NEA has
allocated space in some hawker centres for
businesses which repair small household
appliances or clothing, and will continue
to explore new ways to make it more
convenient for people to repair their goods.
This includes compiling a list of repair
options in Singapore.

Another avenue is to equip Singaporeans
with basic repair skills and empower
more individuals to enter the repair
trade. Therefore, we are supporting nongovernmental
organisations (NGOs) and
corporates, such as Repair Kopitiam, to
promote repair workshops and courses
in the community.

We can also tap on existing platforms to
share or buy second-hand items, such as
mobile applications or physical stores.
To facilitate the sharing of less frequently
used items in the neighbourhood, such
as ladders and trolleys, the People’s
Association (PA) launched Resource Centre
@ Residents’ Committee (RC) in 2016.

However, many Singaporeans are still
unfamiliar with what they can do with
their used clothing, shoes, bags and other
reusables. Instead of donating these items, they often discard them in the blue recycling
bins. Therefore, the NEA will be studying
how to make donating more convenient,
going beyond the list of second-hand shops
and donation points currently found on its
website. This could include making donation
stations accessible to more Singaporeans.

been turning up at a void deck in Jurong West
and in Tampines to seek the help of repair
gurus at Repair Kopitiam sessions every last
Sunday of the month. Repair coaches teach
people how to fix their spoilt items. Organised by
social enterprise Sustainable Living Lab, Repair
Kopitiam aims to tackle the throwaway culture. It
has also organised courses to impart repair skills
and support active ageing in the community. Photo: Repair Kopitiam</caption>

As for the donation of excess food, the NEA
and Singapore Food Agency (SFA) have
produced a set of guidelines to promote
food safety, which includes how to manage
pre-packed or perishable food, and transport
donated food to recipients.

To further nudge people to donate extra food,
the NEA will be working with SFA, National
Volunteer & Philanthropy Centre (NVPC) and
other stakeholders on new initiatives. One
such possibility is a Good Samaritan Law,
which has been implemented overseas to
provide legal protection to food donors.

#### PROMOTE GREEN-LABELLED PRODUCTS

Spending your money on environmentallyfriendly
products is a powerful way of
endorsing a greener planet. The Singapore
Green Label Scheme (SGLS), the NEA’s
Mandatory Energy Labelling Scheme (MELS) for household appliances, and Logo for
Products with Reduced Packaging support
such decisions as they identify products
with minimum environmental impact or
are made with recycled, recyclable or less
materials.

Not only do we want more companies to
design their products with environmental
considerations or import more greenlabelled
products, but we also want them to
adopt a green procurement policy.

borrowed from your nearby RC or Residents’ Network (RN) Resource Centre. PA launched the
Resource Centre @ RC in 2016 across 460 RCs in Singapore. Photo: PA</caption>

The Government has adopted a green
public procurement policy under the Public
Sector Taking the Lead in Environmental
Sustainability (PSTLES) initiative. For example, all Government agencies are
required to purchase energy efficient
appliances with minimum MELS ticks,
and white printing paper certified by SGLS.


#### How do we manage waste sustainably?

Living more sustainable lifestyles means
reducing how much we consume and reusing
our items where possible. When these are not
feasible, recycling comes in, helping us to turn
waste into resources.

Singapore has had some success, recycling
60% of its waste since 2012 by focusing on
individual waste streams. This has led to a
nearly 100% recycling rate for Construction
and Demolition (C&D) waste, ferrous and nonferrous
metals.

![Waste Statistics](/images/ch2_waste_statistics.png)


#### PUTTING C&D WASTE BACK INTO BUILDINGS

C&D waste is generated during the
construction, demolition and renovation of
structures.

To help demolition contractors plan their
demolition procedures to maximise C&D
waste recycling, the Demolition Protocol
was implemented by the Building and
Construction Authority (BCA).

Under the Demolition Protocol, reusable and
non-reusable parts of a building have to be
identified, then separately dismantled and
removed. Reusable parts include piping and
wiring, which are placed in separate bins and
sent to a recycling facility. Non-reusable parts
that contaminate the concrete debris, such as
ceiling boards and tiles, are discarded. Only
when the building has been stripped to its
bare frame can demolition start.

This protocol has led to the development of
several new materials, like recycled concrete
aggregate (RCA), which is made up of more
than 70% demolition waste, reclaimed
from waste concrete made with natural
aggregates.

#### CLOSING THE METAL RESOURCE LOOP

Recycling 99% of ferrous and non-ferrous
metals in Singapore is no mean feat, made
possible only with novel processes that can
detect even a speck of material.

At a metal recovery facility located at Tuas
Marine Transfer Station, 90% of the ferrous
metals and more than three quarters of
the non-ferrous metals are recovered from
incineration bottom ash (IBA) using special
magnets, micro-grain eddy current separators
and multi-stage sieving techniques.

The facility, built on a 1.4 ha plot, is capable of
processing up to 1,800 tonnes of IBA a day.
It has been in operation since July 2015 by
REMEX Minerals Singapore Pte Ltd (REMEX).

#### ENCOURAGING HOUSEHOLDS TO RECYCLE RIGHT

But we can do more in the area of household
recycling. In 2018, only 22% of Singapore’s
domestic waste was recycled, much lower
than the 74% recycling rate for non-domestic
waste.

The infrastructure is already in place. The
National Recycling Programme (NRP) was introduced under the Public Waste Collection
(PWC) scheme in 2001, originally providing
fortnightly door-to-door collection of
recyclables in recycling bags.

However, this form of collection posed
several issues – households did not like
keeping their recyclables for two weeks, new
recycling bags left outside the doors of flats
during delivery were stolen, and recyclables
were pilfered from the bags. In addition,
collection was labour-intensive.

This led to the enhancement of the NRP with
the provision of recycling bins in housing
estates. The recycling bins overcame
the earlier issues, providing residents the
convenience of depositing their recyclables
at any time. The number of recycling bins
gradually grew from one every five Housing
& Development Board (HDB) blocks to one
per block, and the frequency of collection
increased to at least three times a week.
Landed households were each provided with
a recycling bin, emptied once a week along
with weekly garden waste collection for
recycling.

This enhanced NRP also complemented
other modes of recycling such as the sale
of recyclables to the karang guni for a small
price, cash-for-trash collection stations, and
recyclables collection at community events.

While the recyclables collected under the
NRP has increased between 2013 and 2018 (77,000 kg/day to 119,000 kg/day),
approximately 40% of what is thrown into the
blue recycling bins are contaminants. This
refers to items that cannot be recycled (e.g.
toys, clothes and shoes) or contaminated
recyclables (e.g. by remnants of food or
liquid).

To tackle this high contamination rate, the
next phase for household recycling will focus
on improving Singaporeans’ knowledge
about our commingled recycling system and
reducing contamination.

MEWR and the NEA embarked on a
#RecycleRight campaign in 2019, as part
of the Year Towards Zero Waste.

The key messages of the #RecycleRight campaign are:

* Only place the right recyclables into the blue bins, not general waste – follow the labels on the blue bins on what can be put inside
* Make sure recyclables are free from food and liquids
* No need to sort recyclables to be deposited into the blue bins – they will be sorted centrally before being recycled
* Clothes, shoes and stuffed toys are not recyclable. Donate them if they are in good condition

To support this messaging, the NEA has
redesigned the labels on the blue recycling
bins to make information clearer on what
can and cannot be deposited in the bins. The
replacement of the labels is expected to be
completed by mid-2020.


![New blue bin label](/images/ch2_blue_bin_label.jpg)
<caption>New blue recycling bin label helps residents #RecycleRight</caption>

We also recognise that it is important to
make recycling convenient and to make it a
habit in order to boost household recycling.
Surveys conducted by MEWR and the NEA
in 2018 found that 60% of households
recycle regularly at home. Finding recycling
convenient and developing a habit of recycling
were factors that encouraged them to recycle. 

Therefore, since August 2019, the NEA has
been in partnership with IKEA Singapore to
provide residents of Build-to-Order flats in new
HDB precincts with a free household recycling
bin. This bin, redeemable via a voucher at
IKEA Singapore stores, will make it easier for
residents to recycle in their own home.

As we move beyond household recycling to
encourage further conversion of waste into
resources, we will be turning to legislative
or economic measures. As recycling grows,
we will need the recycling industry to
grow in tandem. Hence, we are supporting
the development of the industry through
the Environmental Services Industry
Transformation Map. All these efforts will be
supported by research and development and
our crucial 3P partners.

Together, these will help close the loop on
more waste streams as we adopt a circular
economy approach.
