### Singapore’s inaugural Zero Waste Masterplan maps out the Ministry’s key strategies towards a sustainable, resource-efficient and climate-resilient Singapore. 

Following PM Lee Hsien Loong’s [National Day Rally](https://www.pmo.gov.sg/Newsroom/National-Day-Rally-2019){:target="_blank"}  speech which emphasised the “grave” challenge that climate change poses Singapore, the Masterplan highlights why Singapore needs to adopt a circular economy approach in resource management, and adopt sustainable production and consumption practices.


#### New Zero Waste targets set to #SaveSemakau

The amount of waste disposed of in Singapore has increased seven-fold over the last 40 years. Not only is this a waste of precious resources, it is unsustainable. 

At this rate, the [Semakau Landfill](/semakau_landfill/), Singapore’s only landfill, will run out of space by 2035. This poses a serious problem as it is not possible to keep building new incineration plants in land-scarce Singapore. Incineration also takes energy and generates carbon emissions, which in turn contributes to climate change.

Thus, to extend Semakau’s lifespan beyond 2035, the
Masterplan has set two new targets for 2030:

* To reduce the waste sent to Semakau Landfill each day by 30% - from 0.36kg/capita today to 0.25kg/capita
* To increase our national recycling rate to 70%

While ambitious, the targets are not unattainable if the various measures outlined in the
Masterplan are implemented successfully.

<!--
The Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources will be publishing our inaugural Zero Waste Masterplan in the second half of this year. 

The Masterplan will chart our adoption of a circular economy approach to sustainable waste and resource management. It will detail the key policies and strategies that the Government will be implementing in the next few years, supported by industry transformation and research and development. 

We have been [consulting the public and industry stakeholders](/consultation) on the development of the Masterplan.




The Masterplan will cover the management of three waste streams:

### Electrical and electronic waste

From 2021, producers that supply covered electrical and electronic equipment (EEE) to the local market will be responsible for the end-of-life collection and treatment of their products. Suppliers of consumer EEE will be required to join a Producer Responsibility Organisation (PRO), which will be appointed by NEA, to collect and send e-waste for recycling. A single PRO will benefit from economies of scale, and lower the overall cost of the system. Collection targets will be imposed on the PRO, but penalties for failure to meet collection targets will only be enforced from 2024 to allow transition time.

### Packaging waste

From 2020, producers of packaging and packaged products (i.e., brand owners, manufacturers, importers, and supermarkets) with an annual turnover of more than $10 million will be required to report on the amounts and types of packaging they put on the market, and their plans to reduce, reuse and recycle them.

This will lay the foundation for the introduction of an Extended Producer Responsibility framework which will be implemented by 2025.

### Food waste

From 2024, large commercial and industrial food waste generators will be required to segregate their food waste for treatment. Such premises include 	large hotels and malls, and large industrial developments housing food manufacturers, food caterers and food storage warehouses.

MEWR/NEA will work with the public sector to take the lead in segregating food waste for treatment in large public sector buildings where a significant amount of food waste is generated, from 2021 onwards.

From 2021, developers of new developments which are expected to be large food waste generators will be required to allocate and set aside space for on-site food waste treatment in their design plans. They will also be required to implement on-site food waste treatment from 2024.

We will continue to fine-tune the details and implement the above measures through the Resource Sustainability Bill, which will be introduced later this year.
