### Even as new policies are implemented and infrastructure developed to achieve our vision as a Zero Waste Nation, we
will need to continually improve existing waste management technologies to enhance our treatment of waste and recovery of resources.

For decades, Singapore has invested in
infrastructure to collect, recycle and turn
our waste to energy. Our waste collection
infrastructure, such as refuse chutes, bin
centres and waste collection vehicles
have served us well in maintaining high
environmental public health standards by
ensuring that waste is properly collected and
sent for disposal. Our Waste-to-Energy (WTE)
plants, which reduce waste to ash, enable
extensive space savings at Singapore’s only
landfill while recovering energy from waste.

However, we want to go beyond converting
waste into energy, to produce greener forms
of energy such as syngas and recover other
valuable resources from waste, such as
turning waste into feedstock for the chemical
industry. At the same time, we want to
reduce the landfilling requirements from
any residue of the waste treatment process.
This will reduce our carbon footprint from
incineration and further extend the lifespan
of Semakau Landfill.

The Government has set our sights on closing
the waste loop by encouraging Singaporeans
to waste less and recycle more, developing
new policies, and investing in research and
development to find new ways to convert
waste into usable, and even marketable
products. This includes upgrading our waste
management infrastructure, from collection
to waste treatment and post-treatment
options. We want to make waste collection
more manpower-efficient, improve the energy
efficiency of our WTE plants, and create new
material out of incineration bottom ash (IBA).

Here is how we plan to do it.

#### PNEUMATIC WASTE CONVEYANCE SYSTEM

Waste collection today is often associated with
unpleasant odours and pests. Within many
developments, it is also manpower intensive for
waste to be transported from refuse chutes to
the bin centre.

The Pneumatic Waste Conveyance System
(PWCS) provides a solution to these problems. It
is an automated waste collection system which
conveys waste by air suction from individual
buildings through a network of pipes to a central
location for collection. This removes the need
for manual collection of waste from individual
refuse chutes. As an enclosed system, waste is
not exposed throughout the transfer process,
reducing odour and pest problems. Waste
collection can become more manpowerefficient.
PWCS will offer a cleaner and more
liveable environment.

To increase the adoption of PWCS, since
1 April 2018, new development applications
for non-landed private residential
developments with 500 Dwelling Units (DUs)
or more have been required to implement the
system. This adds to over 140 existing private
residential and commercial developments
with PWCS.

Further economies of scale can be reaped by
implementing district-level PWCS (DPWCS).
Instead of bin centres for each development,
the district can share a central bin centre,
which can be located away from residents’
homes. This will also reduce refuse truck
traffic within the district, as refuse will
only be collected from one bin centre. HDB
has already introduced DPWCS in new
HDB estates such as Tampines North,
Punggol North and Bidadari and will also be
introducing it in the latest new town, Tengah.

The first DPWCS to serve multiple private
developments is being planned for the
Kampong Bugis precinct. It is expected
to serve commercial developments and
approximately 4,000 private residential DUs.

Through these efforts, the Government aims
to mitigate future challenges that the waste
collection industry will face due to increasing
manpower shortages and an ageing
workforce.

#### PILOT MECHANICAL BIOLOGICAL TREATMENT FACILITY

Designed to recover materials from refuse,
a pilot Mechanical and Biological Treatment
(MBT) facility offers an alternative way to
treat Domestic and Trade Waste (DTW).

It will have a mechanical process to recover
recyclables like plastics, ferrous and nonferrous
metals, and an aerobic biological
treatment process to convert the waste into
Solid Recovered Fuel (SRF). Only a small
amount of residue will be left for disposal.

The pilot facility will be able to treat 500
tonnes of DTW daily. The mechanical
process will be able to recover up to 15%
of recyclables, or over 500,000 tonnes of
recyclables over 20 years. With this, we are
able to extract valuable recyclables from
waste that would otherwise be incinerated,
allowing the materials to re-enter the value
chain. Whatever is not recovered will undergo
a biological process which produces SRF as
an end product.

The NEA will monitor the operation of the pilot
facility and assess its viability for
wider adoption.

#### TUASONE WASTE-TO-ENERGY PLANT

The TuasOne WTE plant – Singapore’s 6th
WTE plant – illustrates the circular economy
principle of resource efficiency. With a
treatment capacity of 750 tonnes of waste
per day per ha (t/d/ha), it will be the most
compact plant in the world. It will also be the
most energy-efficient among Singapore’s
existing WTE plants.

Built to meet part of our waste incineration
needs for the next 25 years, the plant –
developed on 4.8 ha of land – will have the
capacity to incinerate 3,600 tonnes of
waste per day.
