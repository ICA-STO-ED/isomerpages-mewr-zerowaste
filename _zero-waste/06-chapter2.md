### Through conscious design, more efficient operations and less wasteful habits, we can keep resources in use for as long as possible, extracting their maximum value.

For decades, businesses and people around
the world believed that the earth’s resources
would not run out. Many live by the linear
economy model whereby materials are
harvested, used to manufacture products, and
eventually discarded.

However, the global population continues to
grow and experts have sounded warnings of
resource constraints with consequences for
generations to come.

We need to change the way we view waste.
Rather than just something useless to be
buried or burnt, waste should be seen as a
valuable material that can be reintroduced
into the production cycle.

In other words, we want to adopt a
circular economy approach by keeping
our resources in use in an endless loop.

### What is a circular economy?

Unlike the linear economy, the circular
economy focuses on designing waste out of
the resource ecosystem and maximising the
value of resources by keeping them in use for
as long as possible.

Many countries, such as the Netherlands,
Finland, China and Japan, already adopt this
approach in their national agenda, driven by
resource scarcity, volatile resource prices, and
the environmental impact from extraction and
excessive use of resources.

Even as we learn from other countries, we
need to examine Singapore’s context and
pinpoint how a circular economy is relevant
to us. Adopting a circular economy approach
can help to contribute to building up three
“Resiliences” to sustain Singapore’s future.

The adoption of the circular economy
approach will require measures to be
taken across the entire value chain, from
production and consumption to waste and resource management. Measures include
better product design that reduces the
amount of resources used at production,
change in consumer habits where products
are repaired instead of replaced with new
ones, and the recycling of waste and their
reintroduction into the value chain.

<caption>A circular economy approach will require measures to be taken across the entire value chain</caption>

We have already embraced the circular
economy approach in several areas through
our successes in closing a number of
resource loops. Almost all construction
waste and metals are recycled.

We have also closed the water loop. By
combining water and sanitation, Singapore
is able to endlessly recycle water, reusing it
again and again. Every drop of used water
is collected and treated, turning much of it
into drinking water again. This has allowed
Singapore to reintroduce up to almost
800,000 m<sup>3</sup> of ultra-pure recycled water into
our system each day.

### SETTING NEW TARGETS TOWARDS ZERO WASTE

Under the [Sustainable Singapore Blueprint
2015](http://www.sustainablesingapore.gov.sg){:target="_blank"}, we set the 2030 target of increasing
our national recycling rate to 70%, domestic
recycling rate to 30% and non-domestic
recycling rate to 81%.

Through the adoption of the circular economy
approach and the efforts outlined in this
Masterplan, we want to go beyond
these targets.

![our zero waste targets](/images/ch2_targets.png)

Achieving this target will require the
successful implementation of the various
measures outlined in this Masterplan,
including those to better manage our priority
waste streams of food waste, e-waste and
packaging waste, including plastics.

Support from all segments of society will also
be needed to take closing our waste loop to
the next level. Individuals should play their
part by recycling right and not contaminating
our blue recycling bins. Businesses that
produce the most electrical and electronic
equipment or packaging will be required to
take a life-cycle approach to products. Large
food waste generators must also ensure
that food waste is properly segregated and
treated.

Lastly, the research and development
community will be crucial in developing
solutions and technologies that enable us
to turn our waste into resources, such as
through the use of incineration bottom ash by
turning it into [NEWSand](/newsand/).

<h3>WHAT DOES THE WASTE-TO-LANDFILL REDUCTION TARGET MEAN FOR EACH PERSON?</h3>

<p>Today, each person disposes of 800g of
waste per day.</p>

<p>To achieve our waste-to-landfill reduction
target of 30%, each person needs to reduce
the total amount of waste they dispose of
per day to 640g by 2030. This adds up to a
reduction of about 30 bananas or 15 glass
bottles per month. It’s that simple!</p>

#### Sustainable production

When companies better manage their
resources and reduce the amount of waste
generated from conducting their business,
both the environment and their
bottom line stand to benefit.

How can they produce sustainably? Some
ways include sustainable design, improving
resource efficiency, and adopting industrial
symbiosis where companies use the waste
of others as raw materials for its own
operations.

#### SUSTAINABLE DESIGN 

Designing products to be more durable and
repairable lengthens their lifespan, delaying
their entry into the waste stream. Creating
them with materials and components that
could be taken apart easily also makes them
easier to recycle.

The National Environment Agency (NEA)
has been encouraging companies to reduce
their packaging waste through the [Singapore
Packaging Agreement](https://www.nea.gov.sg/programmes-grants/schemes/singapore-packaging-agreement){:target="_blank"}, a voluntary agreement formed in 2007 among the Government,
companies, industry associations and nongovernmental
organisations.

Now we are stepping up this effort. The NEA
will introduce [mandatory packaging reporting](/#/)
in 2020 for producers of packaged products
and supermarkets and target to implement
an [Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR)](/#/)
framework for managing packaging waste
including plastics no later than 2025.

Companies are also coming together to
take action through better product design
and processes. For example, as of June
2019, 15 food and beverage (F&B), retail
and hospitality companies, including Hilton
Singapore, Kraftwich and SaladStop!,
have committed to reducing their plastics
production and usage by 2030 through
the World Wide Fund for Nature’s (WWF)
voluntary agreement – [Plastic Action (PACT)](https://www.wwf.sg/business/pact/){:target="_blank"}.
As part of PACT, over 270 F&B outlets in
Singapore have also phased out plastic
straws (as of 1 July 2019).


#### PROMOTING RESOURCE EFFICIENCY

As the world population grows, competition
for resources will increase. According to a
2017 report by the International Resource
Panel, global material resource use is
expected to double between 2015 and 2050
based on current trends.

The report highlighted the need to adopt resource efficiency policies and initiatives, which could save $2.9 to $3.7 trillion a year by 2030. This will also cut resource use by 26% and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by around 20% by 2050.

This global shift towards greater resource
efficiency presents opportunities for
Singapore companies and industries to
be leaders in this area and reap economic
benefits.

We are already making headway in improving
energy efficiency. For instance, the [Energy
Conservation Act (ECA)](https://www.nea.gov.sg/our-services/climate-change-energy-efficiency/energy-efficiency/industrial-sector/mandatory-energy-management-practices-for-existing-industrial-facilities){:target="_blank"} requires large energy
users to adopt good energy management
practices. This includes conducting
regular energy audits, setting up an energy
management system, and submitting energy
efficiency improvement plans.

Companies also track their materials efficiency
through sustainability reports such as
those required by the Singapore Exchange
of Singapore-listed companies. The reports
cover five primary components: (a) material
Environmental Social Governance (ESG) factors,
(b) policy, practices and performance, (c) targets,
(d) sustainability reporting framework and (e)
Board statement.

However, the commercial and industrial sector
still contributes around half of total waste
disposed of. Material and waste audits can thus
allow companies to identify opportunities for
reduction through a systematic evaluation of
material flows and costs, and develop concrete
plans to improve material efficiency. We will be
exploring means to support more companies to
do this.

At the same time, the Sustainable Manufacturing
Centre (SMC) of the Agency for Science,
Technology and Research (A-STAR) aims to
promote sustainability in the manufacturing
industry by bringing industry associations and
the research community together to work with
Government agencies to develop and implement
sustainable manufacturing technologies.

<h3>TWEAKS IN PACKAGING SAVES COMPANY MATERIALS AND MONEY</h3>

<p>By making a crucial material swap, a packaging
company helped its client save money.</p>

<p>Instead of packing its client’s product – a Field
Replacement Unit (FRU) – in a polypropylene
moulded case, Greenpac (S) Pte Ltd designed a
paper carton box with polyethylene foam which
did the job just as well.</p>

<p>This reduced the overall weight of packaging from
5 kg to 1.5 kg, saving 53,000 kg of packaging
material and $6,000 in material costs per year.</p>

<p>This, and several other initiatives, won Greenpac
an Excellence Award (SMEs) at the Singapore
Packaging Agreement Awards in 2017.</p>

#### BRINGING TRANSFORMATIVE TECHNOLOGIES TO THE INDUSTRY

The Model Factory @ Advanced
Remanufacturing and Technology Centre
of A-STAR offers capabilities and expertise
in three areas underpinning smart
manufacturing. It provides companies with
a platform to learn how technologies are
implemented in manufacturing use-cases
or test process improvements without
disrupting their own operations.

![Advanced Remanufacturing and Technology Centre](/images/ch2_ARTC.jpg)

**Secure connectivity and intelligent system**
Real-time analytics allows for decentralised
decision making, while condition monitoring
provides data for predictive model and
optimisation. Together, they make factories
more intelligent, and in turn more agile and
efficient.

**Virtual manufacturing**
With a full digital footprint of a factory, every
machine and process will generate real-time
information that will provide the data required
for optimisation, decision-making, planning and
learning. Meanwhile, virtual design will shorten the
product design life cycle and the need for physical
prototypes. The use of augmented reality will help in
training operators and machine maintenance.

**End-to-end solutions**
The end-to-end digital thread, from customer-specific
orders, product design and manufacturing to aftersales
service, provides seamless data exchange
and new business opportunities. These digital
threads also enable better supply chain
management and management of distributed
manufacturing assets globally.


#### PROMOTING INDUSTRIAL SYMBIOSIS

Industrial symbiosis refers to mutually
beneficial collaborations, where what is
deemed as waste by one company could be
raw material for the operations of another.
This leads to more sustainable industrial
processes and cost savings.

To optimise such alliances, both entities are
typically sited within close proximity to reduce
transportation costs, and their infrastructures
are carefully designed.

Industrial symbiosis can also be applied to
brownfield sites, where waste-resource flows
are matched by an independent organisation.
The Finland Industrial Symbiosis System
(FISS) is one example. To date, there are
around 600 companies and 4,700 resources
involved in the FISS.

In Singapore, industrial symbiosis is
illustrated through the design of the Tuas
Nexus, where the NEA’s Integrated Waste
Management Facility will be integrated with
PUB’s Tuas Water Reclamation Plant. Output
from one facility will be used as feedstock to
another, while keeping the land use footprint
and environmental impact to a minimum.
(See Chapter 4 for more details on Tuas
Nexus.)

Similarly, at upcoming districts such as
Jurong Lake District and Punggol Digital
District, Government agencies across various
domains are working together to optimise
resource flows and minimise transport within
the district. For example, we are exploring
closing waste loops at the district level, such
as by converting food waste into useful
products like compost, which can be used
for landscaping.

<div style="background-color: #eeddca; padding: 5px">
  
<h3>STUDYING THE CIRCULAR ECONOMY ON JURONG ISLAND</h3>

<p>Singapore is home to Jurong Island – one
of the top 10 chemical parks in the world
and a key anchor for Singapore’s energy
and chemicals industry. It is an example of
industrial symbiosis, facilitated by shared
infrastructure and an inter-connected
industrial cluster. To remain competitive,
Jurong Island companies have been seeking
to optimise resources, such as water and
energy, and also to minimise waste in their
own plants.</p>

<img src="/images/ch2_jurong_island.jpg">
<caption>Aerial view of Jurong Island. Photo: JTC</caption>

<p>The close proximity of related industries on
Jurong Island provides an ecosystem where one
company’s product can become the feedstock
of another. For example, waste from some
companies is burnt to generate steam for
industrial use. Similarly, wastewater is recovered
and recycled for industrial use.</p>

<p>However, there are limitations to the efforts by
individual companies. Increasingly, companies
are recognising the importance of collaboration
so as to jointly discover opportunities for further
resource optimisation at the systems level.</p>

<p>To deepen this industrial symbiosis, companies
on Jurong Island have come together to support
a study commissioned by JTC Corporation (JTC)
– the Jurong Island Circular Economy Study. The
study seeks to bring about environmental and
economic gains for companies by mapping out
the current water, energy, and waste flows on
Jurong Island, and to identify further synergies
and reduce resource use at the systems level.</p>

<p>It is the next step towards positioning Jurong
Island as an economically and environmentally
sustainable chemicals park. The study is
ongoing, with recommendations targeted to be
ready in 2020.</p>

### Sustainable consumption

Rising disposable income levels have
led to more comfortable lives for current
generations. But as our affluence grows, so
does our consumption of goods and services.
This in turn generates waste, with the amount
of waste disposed of in Singapore increasing
by over seven times over the last 40 years.

How we consume is influenced by social
norms, such as pressure to over-order food at
meals, keep up with fashion trends, or get the
latest mobile phone model.

To promote more sustainable consumption,
we need to do more and better with less. This
can be achieved by having a reduce and reuse
mindset, and by shifting towards the use of
green products.

#### REDUCE

To reduce waste, we need to be conscious
consumers, mindful of the materials and
energy poured into every product or meal.

**The ongoing fight to curb food waste**

The battle to cut food waste is intensifying,
with more organisations joining hands
to spread the message of sustainable
consumption.

The NEA launched a food waste reduction
publicity and outreach programme in
November 2015 to raise awareness of
Singapore’s food waste situation and
encourage consumers to adopt smart food
purchase, storage and preparation habits to
help them minimise food wastage.

Informational advertisements and
educational videos on practical ways to
reduce food waste were featured on various
mass media platforms to reach the public.
A comprehensive handy guide was also
developed and made available online and
distributed at community events. It provided
tips on reducing food waste in different
scenarios, such as when cooking at home,
eating out or organising events.

The NEA has been ramping up engagement
efforts, such as talks, food waste reduction
demonstrations and other activities with
support from the Food Waste Reduction
Ambassadors (FWRAs) programme. To date,
more than 400 ambassadors have been
trained to help spread the word on food waste
reduction to their communities, families
and friends.

![Alternative text for screen readers](/images/ch2_food_waste_launch.jpg)
<caption>The NEA’s food waste reduction publicity and outreach programme was launched in November 2015. In 2019, the key message was to encourage everyone to “Buy, Order or Cook Just Enough”</caption>

Four years on, as part of the 2019 Year
Towards Zero Waste, the NEA partnered 25
hawker centres and organisations such as
Dairy Farm Singapore, NTUC FairPrice, Prime
Supermarket and Sheng Siong Supermarket,
as well as schools and Institutes of Higher
Learning, to engage consumers at points-ofconsumption.

Together, they promote three key actions that
consumers can adopt to reduce food waste
– order only what you can finish, ask for less
rice or noodles if you cannot finish them and
to say “no” to side dishes you will not eat.

Among the campaign’s features were visual
reminders, such as wobblers, table-top
stickers, wallscapes and pillar wraps, and
an edutainment web series that inspires
viewers to incorporate food waste reduction
practices into their day-to-day lives.

![Launch of Say YES To Waste Less campaign at IKEA Tampines](/images/ch2_sayyestowasteless_campaign.jpg)
<caption>Launch of Say YES To Waste Less campaign at IKEA Tampines on 8 June 2019. The event was
launched by Senior Minister of State for the Environment and Water Resources, Dr Amy Khor</caption>

**Tackling single-use disposables**

Just as important is the need to address the
problem of disposables that are often used
for only a short period before being thrown
away.

The Say YES to Waste Less campaign was
launched on 8 June 2019 to build public
awareness on excessive consumption, the
impact on Singapore’s environment and future
generations, and the need for reduction.

With the campaign message, “Make the Right
Choice. Choose Reusables”, consumers were
encouraged to take simple, actionable steps to
reduce their impact on the environment. They
could start simply by using a reusable bottle,
bag or food container instead of disposables.

At its launch, the campaign brought
together 59 partners, with support from
over 1,600 outlets and premises from
across the F&B, retail, commercial and
community sectors. These partners helped
to nudge consumers to make the right
choice at points of consumption using a
wide range of initiatives. These included
visual reminders at cashier points, training
of cashiers and providing incentives for
using reusables.

The campaign also included district events
and 100 roadshows in collaboration with
the community to build awareness and
encourage action.

To further reduce the use of disposables,
the NEA disallowed their use for dine-in
at new hawker centres such as at Our
Tampines Hub, Pasir Ris Central and
Yishun Park. The NEA has also extended
this requirement to new stallholders
operating in existing hawker centres.

There has also been increasing support from
the private sector to tackle the excessive
use of disposables. Several F&B retail
outlets such as KFC Singapore, Burger King
Singapore and Resorts World Sentosa no
longer provide plastic straws at their outlets.
Yakult Singapore also started selling its
probiotic cultured milk drink without straws.

Packaging-free grocery stores have also
emerged, where packaging is eliminated.
They encourage customers to bring their
own containers, and allow them to buy what
they need instead of a pre-packaged amount.
These stores also offer more competitive
prices as going without packaging reduces
the cost of its products by an estimated
10%, allowing customers to save both the
environment and money.

![Ms Florence Tay and Mr Jeff Lam of UnPackt](/images/ch2_unpackt.jpg)
<caption>Opened in 2018 by Ms Florence Tay and Mr Jeff Lam, the aim of social enterprise UnPackt is to encourage
consumption consciousness so that customers only buy what they need. This also provides fresher food items while
generating less packaging and food waste. Another core objective of UnPackt is to educate the public about zero
waste through workshops, community outreach with schools and corporations, and collaborations with like-minded
social enterprises. Photo: UnPackt Pte Ltd</caption>

#### REUSE AND DONATE

How often have you thrown away a pair of
jeans still in mint condition because it no
longer fits, or a rice cooker that broke down
after just a couple of months?

Often, these items can be repaired, donated
or sold second-hand. We want to establish
a habit of reuse in the community, such that
we will not easily discard unwanted or faulty
products.

To promote the repair trade, the NEA has
allocated space in some hawker centres for
businesses which repair small household
appliances or clothing, and will continue
to explore new ways to make it more
convenient for people to repair their goods.
This includes compiling a list of repair
options in Singapore.

Another avenue is to equip Singaporeans
with basic repair skills and empower
more individuals to enter the repair
trade. Therefore, we are supporting nongovernmental
organisations (NGOs) and
corporates, such as Repair Kopitiam, to
promote repair workshops and courses
in the community.

We can also tap on existing platforms to
share or buy second-hand items, such as
mobile applications or physical stores.
To facilitate the sharing of less frequently
used items in the neighbourhood, such
as ladders and trolleys, the People’s
Association (PA) launched Resource Centre
@ Residents’ Committee (RC) in 2016.

However, many Singaporeans are still
unfamiliar with what they can do with
their used clothing, shoes, bags and other
reusables. Instead of donating these items, they often discard them in the blue recycling
bins. Therefore, the NEA will be studying
how to make donating more convenient,
going beyond the list of second-hand shops
and donation points currently found on its
website. This could include making donation
stations accessible to more Singaporeans.

![Repair Kopitiam](/images/ch2_repair_kopitiam.jpg)
<caption>Residents from every corner of Singapore have
been turning up at a void deck in Jurong West
and in Tampines to seek the help of repair
gurus at Repair Kopitiam sessions every last
Sunday of the month. Repair coaches teach
people how to fix their spoilt items. Organised by
social enterprise Sustainable Living Lab, Repair
Kopitiam aims to tackle the throwaway culture. It
has also organised courses to impart repair skills
and support active ageing in the community. Photo: Repair Kopitiam</caption>

As for the donation of excess food, the NEA
and Singapore Food Agency (SFA) have
produced a set of guidelines to promote
food safety, which includes how to manage
pre-packed or perishable food, and transport
donated food to recipients.

To further nudge people to donate extra food,
the NEA will be working with SFA, National
Volunteer & Philanthropy Centre (NVPC) and
other stakeholders on new initiatives. One
such possibility is a Good Samaritan Law,
which has been implemented overseas to
provide legal protection to food donors.

#### PROMOTE GREEN-LABELLED PRODUCTS

Spending your money on environmentallyfriendly
products is a powerful way of
endorsing a greener planet. The Singapore
Green Label Scheme (SGLS), the NEA’s
Mandatory Energy Labelling Scheme (MELS) for household appliances, and Logo for
Products with Reduced Packaging support
such decisions as they identify products
with minimum environmental impact or
are made with recycled, recyclable or less
materials.

Not only do we want more companies to
design their products with environmental
considerations or import more greenlabelled
products, but we also want them to
adopt a green procurement policy.

![Alternative text for screen readers](/images/ch2_PA_resource_centre.jpg)
<caption>Need a chiller box for a house party or a trolley to move some furniture? These items can be
borrowed from your nearby RC or Residents’ Network (RN) Resource Centre. PA launched the
Resource Centre @ RC in 2016 across 460 RCs in Singapore. Photo: PA</caption>

The Government has adopted a green
public procurement policy under the Public
Sector Taking the Lead in Environmental
Sustainability (PSTLES) initiative. For example, all Government agencies are
required to purchase energy efficient
appliances with minimum MELS ticks,
and white printing paper certified by SGLS.


#### How do we manage waste sustainably?

Living more sustainable lifestyles means
reducing how much we consume and reusing
our items where possible. When these are not
feasible, recycling comes in, helping us to turn
waste into resources.

Singapore has had some success, recycling
60% of its waste since 2012 by focusing on
individual waste streams. This has led to a
nearly 100% recycling rate for Construction
and Demolition (C&D) waste, ferrous and nonferrous
metals.

![Waste Statistics](/images/ch2_waste_statistics.png)


#### PUTTING C&D WASTE BACK INTO BUILDINGS

C&D waste is generated during the
construction, demolition and renovation of
structures.

To help demolition contractors plan their
demolition procedures to maximise C&D
waste recycling, the Demolition Protocol
was implemented by the Building and
Construction Authority (BCA).

Under the Demolition Protocol, reusable and
non-reusable parts of a building have to be
identified, then separately dismantled and
removed. Reusable parts include piping and
wiring, which are placed in separate bins and
sent to a recycling facility. Non-reusable parts
that contaminate the concrete debris, such as
ceiling boards and tiles, are discarded. Only
when the building has been stripped to its
bare frame can demolition start.

This protocol has led to the development of
several new materials, like recycled concrete
aggregate (RCA), which is made up of more
than 70% demolition waste, reclaimed
from waste concrete made with natural
aggregates.
