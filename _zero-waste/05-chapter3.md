### In Singapore’s journey towards a Zero Waste Nation, we are focusing on closing three resource loops: food, electrical and electronic equipment, and packaging, including plastics. Interventions through legislative and economic measures will target the entire value chain,  supported by infrastructure, research and development, and industry development.

#### Three priority waste streams

As Singapore prepares for an increasingly
carbon- and resource-constrained future,
with limited space for waste disposal, MEWR
and the NEA are pushing towards a wider
adoption of circular economy approaches,
where resources are used over and over
again, and waste is designed out of the
system. We have had some successes, like
the near 100% recycling rate for construction
and demolition waste and metals. However,
some types of waste are generated in large
quantities, but have a low recycling rate, such
as food and packaging. Though electrical
and electronic waste (e-waste) makes up
less than 1% of total waste generated in
Singapore, it could have a detrimental effect
on the environment if not properly managed.

This is why we have made food, e-waste,
and packaging, including plastics, our
three priority waste streams for closing the
resource loop and working towards our vision
of a Zero Waste Nation. The Government
will support the proper management of
these three priority waste streams through
a regulatory framework to promote resource
sustainability. The Resource Sustainability Act
is a landmark legislation introduced in 2019
to give effect to the regulatory framework.
Through legislation, the Government will
mandate the segregation and treatment of
food waste by large food waste generators
and impose the Extended Producer
Responsibility framework on producers and
retailers of electrical and electronic equipment
(EEE). The Government will also mandate the
reporting of packaging data and submission
of plans to reduce, reuse or recycle packaging
by producers of packaged products and
supermarkets.

These regulatory measures are expected to
drive demand and create a viable industry
for resource recovery in Singapore. They
have the potential to create net economic
benefit for Singapore and provide an earlymover
advantage in the global push towards
a circular economy. We hope to promote
innovative circular business models and
position our companies to seize opportunities
in the region for specialised waste treatment,
recycling or remanufacturing.

Regulatory measures are complemented
by outreach and engagement efforts to
businesses and consumers, to develop
sustainable production, consumption, and
waste and resource management habits
across the entire value chain.

More on these measures and efforts
will be shared in this chapter.


### Food

Despite Singaporeans’ love for food,
households are one of the largest generators
of food waste, contributing around half of the
food waste generated in Singapore.

According to an NEA study in 2016-2017,
each household disposed of 2.5 kg of
avoidable food waste each week. Rice,
noodles and bread were among the most
commonly wasted food items.

The amount of food waste generated has
grown by almost 30% over the past 10 years
and is expected to rise further with a growing
population. In 2018, food waste made up onefifth
of the total amount of waste disposed of
in Singapore, but only 17% of food waste was
recycled.

There is hope for improvement. The study
also found that more than half of the food
waste could have been prevented if people
were more mindful of how much food they
bought, ordered or cooked.

#### WHY WE SHOULD NOT WASTE FOOD

Food is an essential and precious resource.
Singapore is exposed to the volatilities of the
global food market as we import over 90% of
our food supply. As we work on strengthening
our food security, everyone also needs to play
a part by reducing food wastage.

Food waste also contributes to odour
nuisance in our general waste and attracts
pests, requiring more frequent waste
collection and increased truck traffic on
our roads.

By reducing food waste, we can also reduce
the contamination of recyclables, giving
recycling a boost.

#### CONSUMING FOOD SUSTAINABLY
The best way to manage food waste is
to avoid generating it from the outset.

The NEA has developed various resources
to encourage sustainable consumption of
food. This includes a [food waste reduction guide for consumers](https://www.nea.gov.sg/our-services/waste-management/3r-programmes-and-resources/food-waste-management/food-waste-management-strategies){:target="_blank"}, as well as [food
waste minimisation guidebooks for food
manufacturing establishments, food retail
establishments and supermarkets](https://www.nea.gov.sg/our-services/waste-management/3r-programmes-and-resources/food-waste-management/food-waste-management-strategies){:target="_blank"}. The
guidebooks aim to help such establishments
reduce food waste across the supply chain.
