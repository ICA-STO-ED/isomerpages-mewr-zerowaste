The Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources will be publishing our inaugural Zero Waste Masterplan in the second half of this year. 

The Masterplan will chart our adoption of a circular economy approach to sustainable waste and resource management. It will detail the key policies and strategies that the Government will be implementing in the next few years, supported by industry transformation and research and development. 

Examples of policies include the introduction of the Extended Producer Responsibility approach to managing e-waste by 2021. We will consult the public and industry stakeholders on the development of the Masterplan.
