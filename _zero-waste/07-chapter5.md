### From the adoption of technology to making cleaning and waste management jobs smarter, safer and easier, to helping local
companies go global – the environmental services industry is getting a facelift to sparkle with higher productivity and capabilities.

They keep roads, housing estates, schools
and offices clean. But the labour-intensive
Environmental Services (ES) industry suffers
from an image problem. The industry,
comprising 1,280 licensed cleaning firms, 450
waste management companies and over 300
pest management companies, is often viewed
as low-skilled and low-tech, and overlooked
by young job seekers due to the lack of career
prospects.

But that will soon change. With the adoption
of a circular economy approach in waste and
resource management, we will require the
support of relevant enterprises and
a skilled workforce. This will require the
ES industry to become sleeker and more
sophisticated with a makeover.

This is the aim of the Environmental Services
Industry Transformation Map (ES ITM), which
focuses on four main areas: technology and
innovation, jobs and skills, productivity and
standards, and internationalisation. These
areas will be supported by enablers.

By 2025, we expect about 30,000 people
from the industry to benefit from higher-value
jobs through skills upgrading and technology
adoption.


#### ITM FOCUS 1:  Technology and innovation

By ramping up the use of technology, the
industry will find innovative ways to get
the job done with less sweat – raising the
productivity of all employees. This will also
create new and more highly-skilled jobs that
will attract younger Singaporeans to join the
industry. Ultimately, we hope to export these
technologies overseas.

#### NO LONGER A MAD RUSH FROM BIN TO BIN

There is no longer a need for a two-men
collection crew, running from one recycling
bin to the next, and having to push the
recycling bins to the truck to be emptied.
Now, a truck driver can complete the whole
operation from the comfort of his truck cabin,
thanks to a side loader.

The side loader has a robotic lifting arm
attached to the side of the truck. With simple
button clicks and the use of a joystick, the
driver can lift and empty the recycling bins
into the truck.

Supported by the Singapore Economic
Development Board (EDB), this has helped
waste management firms like 800Super
become more manpower-lean, while
improving the working conditions of its staff.
