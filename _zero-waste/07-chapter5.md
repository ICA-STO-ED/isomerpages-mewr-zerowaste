### From the adoption of technology to making cleaning and waste management jobs smarter, safer and easier, to helping local companies go global – the environmental services industry is getting a facelift to sparkle with higher productivity and capabilities.

They keep roads, housing estates, schools
and offices clean. But the labour-intensive
Environmental Services (ES) industry suffers
from an image problem. The industry,
comprising 1,280 licensed cleaning firms, 450
waste management companies and over 300
pest management companies, is often viewed
as low-skilled and low-tech, and overlooked
by young job seekers due to the lack of career
prospects.

But that will soon change. With the adoption
of a circular economy approach in waste and
resource management, we will require the
support of relevant enterprises and
a skilled workforce. This will require the
ES industry to become sleeker and more
sophisticated with a makeover.

This is the aim of the Environmental Services
Industry Transformation Map (ES ITM), which
focuses on four main areas: technology and
innovation, jobs and skills, productivity and
standards, and internationalisation. These
areas will be supported by enablers.

By 2025, we expect about 30,000 people
from the industry to benefit from higher-value
jobs through skills upgrading and technology
adoption.


#### ITM FOCUS 1:  Technology and innovation

By ramping up the use of technology, the
industry will find innovative ways to get
the job done with less sweat – raising the
productivity of all employees. This will also
create new and more highly-skilled jobs that
will attract younger Singaporeans to join the
industry. Ultimately, we hope to export these
technologies overseas.

Here are two strategies to achieve this target:

#### STRATEGY 1 SPUR INNOVATION

There are four approaches to drive the
development of new technologies
and solutions:

* Develop new ways to perform cleaning and waste management tasks that can be scalable and replicated overseas
* Help companies expand their capabilities and grow by providing opportunities to expand their businesses in global markets
* Promote research and development (R&D) within companies
* Position Singapore as the technology centre of excellence by showcasing locally developed cleaning and waste management solutions, and nurturing companies which innovate

Instead of relying heavily on manual
labour, Singapore aims to automate waste
management processes, including waste
collection and the sorting of recyclables.
Doing so will make the industry less labourintensive,
enable workers to take on more
complex tasks and improve overall efficiency.

To encourage Singapore companies to
develop novel ES solutions that can cut
our manpower needs, bring about cost
savings, and improve the quality of
operations, the NEA and Enterprise Singapore
launched the Gov-PACT innovation calls. The
opportunity to supply such solutions to the
Government will help our local enterprises
build innovation capabilities and track records
when scaling up locally or exporting overseas.

Companies can tap on several funds to
reduce the cost of venturing into R&D,
or automating their processes.

<h4>NO LONGER A MAD RUSH FROM BIN TO BIN</h4>

<p>There is no longer a need for a two-men
collection crew, running from one recycling
bin to the next, and having to push the
recycling bins to the truck to be emptied.
Now, a truck driver can complete the whole
operation from the comfort of his truck cabin,
thanks to a side loader.</p>

<img src="/images/ch5-sideloader.jpg" alt="Recycling truck side loader">

<p>The side loader has a robotic lifting arm
attached to the side of the truck. With simple
button clicks and the use of a joystick, the
driver can lift and empty the recycling bins
into the truck.</p>

<p>Supported by the Singapore Economic
Development Board (EDB), this has helped
waste management firms like 800Super
become more manpower-lean, while
improving the working conditions of its staff.</p>

#### STRATEGY 2 DRIVE WIDESPREAD ADOPTION OF TECHNOLOGY

To encourage the adoption of technology, we focus on three areas:

* Identify technologies to be used on a wider scale
* Establish partnerships for technology exchanges
* Leverage platforms such as the Whole-of-Government Business Grants Portal to provide a technology repository for ease
of technology adoption, and Technology Connect Sessions to link the technology providers to service buyers

If we want to create a leaner, more elderly-friendly
and productive industry, we need to change the way we currently clean spaces
and manage waste.

Job redesign is the way forward. The
ES Job Redesign Initiative was a joint
collaboration between the NEA and
Workforce Singapore (WSG), supported by the
Environmental Management Association of
Singapore (EMAS) and Waste Management
and Recycling Association of Singapore
(WMRAS). It provided a list of solutions that
companies were able to adopt easily, as well
as a grant that they could tap on.

The NEA also launched a $30 million
[Productivity Solutions Grant (PSG)](https://www.nea.gov.sg/industry-transformation-map/productivity-solutions-grant-(psg)){:target="_blank"} that funds
the adoption of commercially available and
proven ES technologies, including equipment
and digital solutions that raise productivity.
It is open to both small and medium-sized
enterprises (SMEs) and multinational
corporations.

#### ITM FOCUS 2: Jobs and skills

While technology makes jobs easier, it is also
crucial to improve the skills of workers to
take on higher-value jobs within the industry.
The overall goal is to do more with less –
reducing manpower needs through better
infrastructure and building design, as well
as promoting a “self-serve” mindset where
people clean up after themselves.

There are three strategies to achieve
these goals:

#### STRATEGY 1 - MODERATE MANPOWER DEMAND

Everyone plays an important part in
minimising the need for cleaning and waste
management services. This can be done
through simple acts of clearing trays after
meals at hawker centres and food courts, or
reducing the waste we throw away.

The load of ES workers can be lightened
through the following measures:

* Design buildings that enable cleaning and waste collection to be done faster, easier and with fewer workers
* Encourage Singaporeans to keep their surroundings clean through ongoing programmes such as the Keep Singapore Clean Movement, Tray Return initiative and the Daily Cleaning at Ministry of Education (MOE) schools
* Promote the habit of reducing, reusing and recycling

#### STRATEGY 2 - SUSTAINABLE MANPOWER SUPPLY

As we aim to reduce manpower in the
industry, there is still a need to ensure a
steady stream of workers for the future.

We look to improve on six areas:

* Redesign jobs and adopt automation and assistive technology to reduce the physical demands of the job. This will make the work less strenuous for older employees and reduce the total number of workers needed
* Focus on attracting mid-career switches, senior workers, women returning to the workforce and fresh school leavers
* Improve the industry’s image
* Strengthen human resource policies and practices
* Facilitate internship opportunities
* Tap on National Jobs Bank to connect employers with suitable candidates

The NEA is working with WSG, the industry
and solution providers to encourage
companies on these fronts. For instance,
they have organised appreciation events
for ES professionals to recognise their
commitment and excellence in their work.
They also collaborated with Institutes of
Higher Learning (IHLs) to attract the younger
generation to the industry, such as by
increasing internship opportunities.
