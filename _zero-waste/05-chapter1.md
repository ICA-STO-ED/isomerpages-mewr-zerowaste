### Singapore has an efficient waste collection and disposal system. But if we wish to meet the new environmental challenges we face and continue to grow sustainably, we would need to change the way we view waste management and encourage everyone to consume less and conserve more.



####The case for “Zero Waste”


At the heart of Singapore’s rapid development
lies an inconvenient question: Is it
sustainable? Resources around the world
are being used up far faster than they are
replenished, and the burning of fossil fuels
has caused the build-up of greenhouse gases
and rising global temperatures.

As the global community shifts towards lowcarbon
economies to ensure a sustainable
future, Singapore plays our part by following
three key principles:

* First, economic development, environmental protection and social inclusion are equally important

* Second, everyone must work together to achieve the best outcome

* Third, plans and policies should be focused on the long term and cater to the local context, with an integrated approach to achieve better synergies and resource efficiencies

These principles have guided our policies on
waste management, and will continue to do
so as we confront environmental challenges
such as climate change and a growing
worldwide waste problem.
