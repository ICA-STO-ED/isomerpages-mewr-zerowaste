### As Singapore grapples with climate change and mounting waste, we are investing in research and development (R&D) and collaborating with industry experts to develop new, more efficient and eco-friendly ways to support the circular
economy approach by recovering resources from waste. 

Be it using microbes to convert food waste
into compost, or turning incineration ash
into construction materials – these are just
two of the many possible ways to close our
waste and resource loops through recycling
or reuse.

These innovations came about because
we have been experimenting with cuttingedge
science and technology for more
sustainable solutions.

For instance, R&D enabled the creation of
Semakau Landfill, the first offshore landfill
of its kind in the world, and Tuas Nexus –
the first Waste-to-Energy incineration plant
co-located with a water treatment facility to
reap synergies.

As we face increasingly pressing and complex
environmental issues, it is not enough to
rely solely on our current expertise and
infrastructure, or shape greener behaviour
with policies and regulations alone.
We will continue focusing on R&D to create
and refine new technologies, products or
systems that we can use and eventually share
with others. In the coming years, we hope
to pioneer transformative ways to enable
Singapore to maximise our resource use.

#### Overcoming challenges and creating opportunities, together

Developing cutting-edge technologies
requires collective effort, bringing together
the expertise and resources of academia,
enterprise and Government. Each has an
important role to play.

* Academia from Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs), Research Institutes (RIs) and polytechnics contribute deep scientific
knowledge, scholarship, and know-how to turn theoretical concepts into potential solutions
* Enterprises provide market experience and ideas, and in some instances, financial resources or manpower. They are crucial
partners for test-bedding R&D outcomes, scaling up solutions, and translating them into commercially viable applications
* The Government helps nurture and grow a thriving ecosystem, catalysing R&D by providing infrastructure, funding support,
policy guidance, platforms for collaboration, and test-bedding opportunities

Having a cohesive R&D ecosystem helps turn
ideas into commercially viable solutions. This
goes from envisioning and theorising the best
scientific approach to a given problem, testing
it in a laboratory, to piloting it under real life
conditions. Eventually, we will have a marketready
solution.

This approach benefits all parties. Academics
can see their ideas translated into real-life
applications, while enterprises gain new
business opportunities. All these boost
economic growth and create highly-skilled
jobs.

Our solutions could help other cities and
regions too, and position Singapore as a
global leader and centre of excellence in
waste management and circular economy
solutions.

<h4>CROSS-BORDER PARTNERSHIPS YIELD GREENER E-WASTE RECYCLING METHODS</h4>

<p>From extracting gold, silver and other precious
or strategic metals from printed circuit boards
without using harmful pollutants, to creating
greener chemical processes to recover
materials from laptop batteries – these are
just two tracks of R&D that the Nanyang
Technological University (NTU) Singapore-CEA
Alliance for Research in Circular Economy
(SCARCE) will focus on to develop less energyintensive
and more eco-friendly methods to
treat and recycle e-waste.</p>

<p>SCARCE is a research centre that the
French Alternative Energies and Atomic
Energy Commission (CEA), a renowned
multidisciplinary research centre in Europe,
has set up together with NTU, and is CEA’s
first joint laboratory outside France. It is also
the first and largest single recipient of funding
under the NEA’s Closing the Waste Loop R&D
Initiative, with the NEA committing $12.5
million towards this $20 million centre.</p>

<p>One of its research projects is to develop
eco-friendly methods of recycling lithium ion
batteries commonly used in laptops, mobile
phones and tablets. The goal is to extract up to
75% of the useful metals by weight, like cobalt,
nickel and lithium, from used batteries. These
can then be reused to produce new batteries.</p>

<p>Another project will look at extracting valuable
metals from printed circuit boards, which are
thin copper-plated or etched circuitry boards
that mount integrated chips and electronic
components in electronic equipment and
appliances. The target is to develop novel
methods to separate and recover metals,
organics and ceramics from these discarded
boards.</p>

<p>Local companies like Virogreen (Singapore) Pte
Ltd have plans to collaborate with SCARCE,
while TES-AMM (Singapore) Pte Ltd has
expressed interest in industrial-scale pilot
testing, to take the developed technology from
the lab to the industry.</p>
