### In Singapore’s journey towards a Zero Waste Nation, we are focusing on closing three resource loops: food, electrical and electronic equipment, and packaging, including plastics. 

Interventions through legislative and economic measures will target the entire value chain,  supported by infrastructure, research and development, and industry development.

#### Three priority waste streams

As Singapore prepares for an increasingly
carbon- and resource-constrained future,
with limited space for waste disposal, MEWR
and the NEA are pushing towards a wider
adoption of circular economy approaches,
where resources are used over and over
again, and waste is designed out of the
system. We have had some successes, like
the near 100% recycling rate for construction
and demolition waste and metals. However,
some types of waste are generated in large
quantities, but have a low recycling rate, such
as food and packaging. Though electrical
and electronic waste (e-waste) makes up
less than 1% of total waste generated in
Singapore, it could have a detrimental effect
on the environment if not properly managed.

This is why we have made food, e-waste,
and packaging, including plastics, our
three priority waste streams for closing the
resource loop and working towards our vision
of a Zero Waste Nation. The Government
will support the proper management of
these three priority waste streams through
a regulatory framework to promote resource
sustainability. The Resource Sustainability Act
is a landmark legislation introduced in 2019
to give effect to the regulatory framework.
Through legislation, the Government will
mandate the segregation and treatment of
food waste by large food waste generators
and impose the Extended Producer
Responsibility framework on producers and
retailers of electrical and electronic equipment
(EEE). The Government will also mandate the
reporting of packaging data and submission
of plans to reduce, reuse or recycle packaging
by producers of packaged products and
supermarkets.

These regulatory measures are expected to
drive demand and create a viable industry
for resource recovery in Singapore. They
have the potential to create net economic
benefit for Singapore and provide an earlymover
advantage in the global push towards
a circular economy. We hope to promote
innovative circular business models and
position our companies to seize opportunities
in the region for specialised waste treatment,
recycling or remanufacturing.

Regulatory measures are complemented
by outreach and engagement efforts to
businesses and consumers, to develop
sustainable production, consumption, and
waste and resource management habits
across the entire value chain.

More on these measures and efforts
will be shared in this chapter.




#### Electrical and electronic equipment


As a country, we discard an estimated 60,000 tonnes of e-waste annually. This is equivalent to each person throwing away 11kg of e-waste, or the weight of 73 mobile phones.

With new mobile phone and laptop models launched every few months, and smart televisions and other
tech gadgets becoming more common, the amount of e-waste generated will only increase.

E-waste is EEE that has been thrown away.
EEE refers to anything powered by an electrical
source, including laptops, mobile phones,
televisions, refrigerators, as well as batteries
and electric mobility devices. It makes up less
than 1% of total waste generated in Singapore,
but contains small amounts of hazardous
substances such as mercury and cadmium and
may be potentially harmful to human health and
the environment if improperly disposed of.

However, e-waste also offers great potential for
the circular economy approach. EEE contains
valuable resources such as precious metals and
working components. If we are able to extract
these resources or reuse them, we can reduce
the need to mine virgin raw materials.

#### RESTRICTIONS ON HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES IN EEE

Since June 2017, Singapore has restricted
six hazardous substances found in common
types of EEE to reduce the chances of these
substances entering our environment due to
improper disposal methods.

Singapore also ratified the Minamata
Convention on Mercury. Since 31 March
2018, Singapore has phased out all batteries
(including button cell batteries) containing
more than 5 ppm by weight of mercury. The
manufacture, import and export of certain
mercury-added products such as fluorescent
lamps (exceeding specified mercury limits)
and non-electronic measuring devices will be
phased out by 1 January 2020.

But many more forms of EEE still enter our
shores. To promote proper recycling and
treatment of discarded EEE, the NEA formed
a national voluntary partnership for e-waste
recycling in 2015. Members work together
to spearhead recycling programmes for such
wastes.

#### RECYCLING NATION’S ELECTRONIC WASTE (RENEW) PROGRAMME

The RENEW programme was launched in
2012 to encourage the public to dispose
of their electrical and electronic devices in
a responsible manner. The programme, a
collaboration between StarHub, DHL, and
TES, and supported by the NEA, aims to
make e-waste recycling more convenient
and accessible by placing collection bins all
around the island.

Since its launch, more than 450 RENEW
bins have been placed at over 400
locations (as of March 2019), including
Government buildings, community clubs,
schools, condominiums, shopping malls
and major electronics retail stores.

They each come with a deposit slot,
which is large enough to fit items such as
cables, mobile phones, tablets, laptops,
DVD players, car stereos, telephones and
answering machines.

The programme has collected more
than 320 tonnes of e-waste since 2012,
with the e-waste collection rate growing
exponentially over the years – over 126
tonnes was collected in 2018, up from 2
tonnes in 2012.

#### THE E-WASTE MANAGEMENT ROADMAP

To ensure the proper treatment of EEE at their
end-of-life and prevent the valuable resources
they contain from going to waste, Singapore
is implementing the Extended Producer
Responsibility (EPR) approach to manage
e-waste. The legislative framework will be
provided under the Resource Sustainability
Act. EPR is an environmental policy tool that has been used effectively to promote
e-waste recycling in other countries, including
South Korea and Sweden. While producers
are conventionally only responsible for the
manufacture and sales of their products, EPR
extends their responsibility to the proper end-of-
life management of their products.

Come 2021, producers of EEE – including
manufacturers and importers – will be physically
and/or financially responsible for the end-of-life
treatment of their products. This means they will
need to collect and ensure that the products are
recycled by licensed companies.

Producers of covered consumer EEE, which
are products that are commonly used by the
general public such as laptops, mobile phones,
and household appliances, are required to join a
Producer Responsibility Scheme (PRS).

The operator of the PRS will be appointed by the
NEA, and take on the producers’ responsibilities
to develop and implement a collection and
recycling system specifically for consumer EEE.
This will include scheduling collection drives,
providing e-waste bins, transporting the e-waste
to licensed recyclers, and reporting the tonnage
of e-waste collected and recycled to the NEA.

The PRS will also need to conduct public
education programmes to encourage e-waste
recycling and meet e-waste collection targets.

As important touchpoints for consumers,
retailers will be required to provide free onefor-
one take-back services upon the delivery
of new products.

For large EEE retailers with a floor area
above 300 m<sup>2</sup>, provision of in-store e-waste
collection points for Information and
Communication Technology (ICT) equipment,
lamps and/or batteries will be made mandatory.

As for non-consumer EEE, which includes
solar photovoltaic (PV) panels and servers,
their producers will be required to provide free
take-back services for all of their end-of-life
equipment from their clients upon request.

Having an e-waste management system
will reduce the risk of improper handling of
e-waste, and through it, support a circular
economy approach by harvesting the
precious metals in e-waste, turning trash into
treasure.

#### Packaging, including plastics

Packaging can be made from any material
and is used to contain, protect, handle,
deliver or present goods. A large proportion
of our domestic waste is packaging waste.
In 2018, about one-third of domestic waste
disposed of consisted of packaging waste.
Approximately 55% of the packaging waste
was plastic packaging, whilst 25% was paper
packaging. The remaining 20% was made up
of other types of packaging materials, such as
metal and glass.

As packaging is so common yet hardly
reused, we need to find ways to reduce
and consume them more sustainably.

#### ENCOURAGING SUSTAINABLE CONSUMPTION OF PACKAGING

**The Singapore Packaging Agreement**

![Singapore Packaging Agreement logo](/images/ch3-singapore-packaging-agreement.png)

The Singapore Packaging Agreement (SPA) is a joint initiative started in 2007 by the Government, industry and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) to reduce packaging waste. Since its inception, more than 200 organisations in Singapore have worked together to cut down on packaging waste. As of 2019, they have cumulatively reduced about 54,000 tonnes of packaging waste, resulting in estimated packaging material cost savings of $130 million for locally consumed products.

The NEA will continue to work with the industry to develop its capabilities in adopting the circular economy approach through sustainable production and design, and establishing best practices in the 3Rs (reduce, reuse 
and recycle).

**Supporting ground-up movements**

We are supporting ground-up initiatives through funding support. 
One such initiative was Zero Waste SG’s Bring Your Own (BYO) campaign, supported by the Call for Ideas Fund, aimed at encouraging consumers to use reusable bags and containers when they buy takeaway food, beverages and groceries. Since 2017, more than 400 retail outlets have joined the campaign, providing incentives to customers who bring their own reusables. This has saved approximately two million pieces of plastic disposables and packaging. Leveraging the success of BYO, the NEA supported Zero Waste SG with the Partnership Fund to further develop the campaign in 2019 into Bring Your Own Bag (BYOB) to focus on reducing disposable plastic bag usage. 


#### THE PACKAGING WASTE MANAGEMENT ROADMAP

Packaging is not all bad. It extends the shelf life of food and protects new products from damage during transportation. However, the problem  is excessive packaging. That is why we are introducing measures to encourage companies to adopt sustainable production by reducing packaging upstream. 

Mandatory reporting of packaging data and 3R plans for packaging will be introduced in 2020 and legislated under the Resource Sustainability Act. This builds on an existing mandatory waste reporting framework for large malls and hotels, which will also be expanded to all large industrial and commercial premises, including large convention and exhibition centres, in 2020. 
For the mandatory packaging reporting framework, for a start, producers of packaged products and supermarkets with an annual turnover of more than $10 million will be required to report data on packaging that they put on the market and their 3R plans for packaging. 

The mandatory packaging reporting framework will also lay the foundation for an EPR framework for managing packaging waste, including plastics. This ensures producers are responsible for the collection and recycling of the materials they use to package their products. We are currently studying the approach, and will hold consultations with the industry. The aim is 
to have the EPR system for packaging waste management in place no later than 2025.

#### CLOSING THE PLASTICS LOOP

The use of plastics is prevalent in our daily lives  – many of our beverage bottles, takeaway food containers, and grocery bags are made of plastics. While plastics can be useful, they are often used in excess and discarded in large amounts.

Plastic has become an issue of significant concern globally as countries re-examine how to sustainably manage their plastic waste. In Singapore, we incinerate all our general waste, minimising the amount of plastic that ends up as litter both on land and in the oceans. At the same time, with the drive towards circular economy to replace the “take-make-dispose” linear economy, and the push to reduce industrial carbon emissions, we have observed an increasing interest among the industry to explore more advanced technology to close the plastics loop. 

Take for example, the adoption of chemical recycling to turn plastic into feedstock or fuel. Apart from the current prevalent technology of using mechanical recycling to recycle plastics, chemical recycling technology involves converting separated or mixed plastics back into pyrolysis oil, naphtha, methanol and syngas. These products can either be converted back into building blocks which can be used to make new plastic products, or converted into fuel to replace fossil fuel sources. In particular, there are opportunities for mixed or dirty plastics, which cannot be recycled currently through mechanical means, to be recycled. As a petrochemical hub, Singapore is well-placed to harness this new growth area to close the plastics loop. 

The Government will work with stakeholders from various industry sectors to explore how these technologies can be applied to Singapore such that it is both environmentally and economically sustainable. We will also continue to engage stakeholders to holistically assess the benefits of other measures to manage plastic waste better. For instance, imposing a charge for single-use plastic bags may divert demand to paper or bio-degradable bags, which may not be more resource-efficient from a lifecycle perspective. This is because the production and disposal of all materials have some degree of environmental impact. Therefore, we will work on managing excessive consumption of all types of packaging and disposables.

Through the adoption of a circular economy
approach to close the resource loops of
food waste, e-waste and packaging waste,
including plastics, we can move closer
towards our Zero Waste future, where both
households and the industry consume less,
waste less and recycle more.
