### Singapore is working towards becoming a zero waste nation by reducing our consumption of materials, and reusing and recycling them to give them a second lease of life. 

In 2017, Singapore generated over 7.7 million tonnes of waste. Thatâ€™s enough to fill 3,000 Olympic-sized swimming pools!

Singapore's growing population and economy have also contributed to a **seven-fold increase** in the amount of solid waste disposed of from 1,260 tonnes per day in 1970 to 8,443 tonnes per day in 2017.

 
### Where does our waste go?

Everyday, about 37% of our waste generated will be incinerated at one of our four waste-to-energy (WTE) incineration plants. Incineration reduces the volume of solid waste by about 90 per cent.

The resulting incinerated ash as well as other non-incinerable solid wastes will then make their way to Semakau Landfill.

### Semakau Landfill

Semakau Landfill is Singapore's one and only landfill. It receives more than 2,000 tonnes of WTE incineration ash and non-
incinerable waste daily.

At our current rate of waste growth, **Semakau Landfill will run out of space by 2035**. 

It is estimated that a new waste-to-energy incineration plant will be needed every 7 to 10 years and a new offshore landfill will be needed every 30 to 35 years. This is unsustainable in land scarce Singapore.

### How will we achieve our Zero Waste vision?

* Better recycling infrastructure support to facilitate better recycling practices, such as centralized chutes for all new HDB flats.
* [Pneumatic Waste Conveyance Systems](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/about-us/our-role/smart-and-sustainable-living/hdb-greenprint/waste-management){:target="_blank"} introduced in HDB towns to support convenient and hygienic waste disposal
* Build an [Integrated Waste Management Facility](https://www.nea.gov.sg/our-services/waste-management/waste-management-infrastructure/integrated-waste-management-facility){:target="_blank"}  which will have the capacity to segregate recyclables from waste
* Introduction of [Extended Producer Responsibility](/Extended-Producer-Responsibility/) framework by 2021 to enhance recycling and manage electrical and electronic waste
* Implementation of [Mandatory Reporting of Packaging Waste](/Mandatory-Reporting-Packaging-Waste/) and packaging waste reduction plans by 2021
* Support the wider use of on-site food waste digesters at commercial premises and hawker centres
* Explore the reuse of incineration bottom ash to extend the lifespan of Semakau Landfill
