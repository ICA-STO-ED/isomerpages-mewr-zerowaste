### Singapore is working towards becoming a zero waste nation by reducing our consumption of materials, and reusing and recycling them to give them a second lease of life. It keeps Singapore clean and healthy, conserves precious resources, and frees up land that would have otherwise been used for landfills. 

In 2017, Singapore generated 7.7 million tonnes of waste.
* That’s enough to fill 3,000 Olympic-sized swimming pools. 
* That works out to 1,400 kilograms (kg) per person - the weight of a pick-up truck or an adult giraffe.
Overall, the recycling rate remained unchanged at 61 per cent from 2016.

Of the waste generated in 2017, more than half - almost 4.72 million tonnes - was recycled. Even so, the amount of refuse sent for disposal has climbed over the years. 

Over the period 2006 to 2016, the waste we generated increased by 50%. At this rate, we will run out of space at Semakau landfill by 2035, which for many of us, will be within our lifetime.

Singapore’s population grew 2.5 times over the past 40 years, but our waste disposed has increased more than seven-fold during the same period from 1,200 tonnes per day in 1970 to 8,443 tonnes per day in 2017.



Each person throws away 810g of waste per day

 In 2017, 1.67 million tonnes of waste were disposed of by the domestic sector. Of this, about one-third is packaging waste. At the current rate of waste disposal, a new waste-to-energy plant is required to be built every seven to 10 years, and a new landfill is needed every 35 years. This is not sustainable given Singapore’s land constraints. Hence, it is important for everyone to play their part in minimising packaging waste.
 
# Semakau Landfill

Semakau Landfill is Singapore's one and only landfill. 

At our current rate of waste growth, Semakau Landfill will run out of space by 2035. A new waste-to-energy incineration plant will be needed every 7 to 10 years and a new offshore landfill will be needed every 30 to 35 years. This is unsustainable in land scarce Singapore.

# How will we achieve Towards a Zero Waste Nation?

* Better recycling infrastructure support to facilitate better recycling practices, such as centralized chutes for all new HDB flats.
* Pneumatic Waste Conveyance Systems introduced in HDB towns to support convenient and hygienic waste disposal
*  Build an Integrated Waste Management Facility which will have the capacity to segregate recyclables from waste
*  Introduction of more initiatives to reduce food waste in F&B businesses and to improve recycling of electrical and electronic waste


# Our 2030 Targets

National Recycling rate: 70%
Domestical recycling rate: 30%
Non-domestic recycling rate: 81%
