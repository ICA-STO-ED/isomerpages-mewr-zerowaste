### Singapore is working towards becoming a zero waste nation by reducing our consumption of materials, and reusing and recycling them to give them a second lease of life. 

In 2017, Singapore generated over 7.7 million tonnes of waste. That’s enough to fill 3,000 Olympic-sized swimming pools!

Singapore's growing population and economy have also contributed to a **seven-fold increase** in the amount of solid waste disposed of from 1,260 tonnes per day in 1970 to 8,443 tonnes per day in 2017.

 
### Where does our waste go?

Everyday, about 37% of our waste generated will be incinerated at one of our four waste-to-energy (WTE) incineration plants. Incineration reduces the volume of solid waste by about 90 per cent.

The resulting incineratied ash as well as other non-incinerable solid wastes will then make their way to Semakau Landfill.

### Semakau Landfill

Semakau Landfill is Singapore's one and only landfill. It receives more than 2,000 tonnes of WTE incineration ash and non-
incinerable waste daily.

At our current rate of waste growth, **Semakau Landfill will run out of space by 2035**. 

It is estimated that a new waste-to-energy incineration plant will be needed every 7 to 10 years and a new offshore landfill will be needed every 30 to 35 years. This is unsustainable in land scarce Singapore.

### How will we achieve our Zero Waste vision?

* Better recycling infrastructure support to facilitate better recycling practices, such as centralized chutes for all new HDB flats.
* [Pneumatic Waste Conveyance Systems](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/about-us/our-role/smart-and-sustainable-living/hdb-greenprint/waste-management){:target="_blank"} introduced in HDB towns to support convenient and hygienic waste disposal
* Build an [Integrated Waste Management Facility](https://www.nea.gov.sg/our-services/waste-management/waste-management-infrastructure/integrated-waste-management-facility){:target="_blank"}  which will have the capacity to segregate recyclables from waste
* Introduction of [Extended Producer Responsibility](/Extended-Producer-Responsibility/) framework by 2021 to enhance recycling and manage electrical and electronic waste. 
* Implementation of [mandatory reporting of packaging data](/Mandatory-Reporting-Packaging-Waste/) and packaging waste reduction plans by 2021, 
* Support the wider use of on-site food waste digesters at commercial premises and hawker centres. 
* Explore the reuse of incineration bottom ash to extend the lifespan of Semakau Landfill.


### Your role as an individual

Government and businesses can only do so much. We cannot legislate desirable behaviour – we need to change societal norms and people’s mindsets, so that individuals are personally committed to living a “zero waste 3R lifestyle”.
We must raise awareness among the public to love and to take care of our environment.

By reducing our waste and diverting recyclable materials from the rubbish chute, we send less to the landfill and length its lifespan

     


 

### Our 2030 Recycling Targets

National Recycling rate: 70%

Domestical recycling rate: 30%

Non-domestic recycling rate: 81%

Overall, the recycling rate remained unchanged at 61 per cent from 2016.

Of the waste generated in 2017, more than half - almost 4.72 million tonnes - was recycled. Even so, the amount of refuse sent for disposal has climbed over the years. 



 
 
 It keeps Singapore clean and healthy, conserves precious resources, and frees up land that would have otherwise been used for landfills.
