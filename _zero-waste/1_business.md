### Reducing waste and developing a circular economy will benefit the environment and create economic opportunities.

As a small city state, Singapore has always been keenly aware of the need to balance economic development and environmental sustainability. Growing our economy consumes energy, water and other resources which we lack, and generates sewerage and solid waste that must be disposed of. Challenges for any country; but especially so for Singapore where resources and land are scarce. Our remaining Semakau Landfill will be filled up within years at our current rate of waste generation.

To overcome these challenges and continue to grow sustainably, Singapore must embrace the circular economy. This requires a shift from the ‘use and throw’ mentality, to one where resources are re-used for as long as possible. It can be done. In the water sector, we have closed the water loop by turning our used water into NEWater, and significantly enhanced our water resilience and sustainability.

We are now turning our attention to closing the waste loop. The Sustainable Singapore Blueprint outlines part of our strategy to become a Zero Waste Nation and achieve a 70% recycling rate by 2030. We will go further. Upstream – to encourage product design for ease of recycling, and a repair culture among consumers. And downstream – to maximise resource recovery from waste.

## What is a circular economy?

A circular economy is an alternative to a traditional linear economy (make, use, dispose) in which we keep resources in use for as long as possible, extract the maximum value from them whilst in use, then recover and regenerate products and materials at the end of each service life.



## Why a circular economy is important

As well as creating new opportunities for growth, a more circular economy will:

* reduce waste
* drive greater resource productivity 
* deliver a more competitive economy
* position Singapore to better address emerging resource security/scarcity issues in the future. 
* help reduce the environmental impacts of our production and consumption in both Singapore and abroad
